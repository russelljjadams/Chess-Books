1. e4 { Version 1.0 ##DO NOT DELETE##
_Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations, and Games_ 
by László Polgár was put into electronic form by a distributed effort of 
64 chess enthusists from 12 different countries around the world.  Every 
participant contributed at least 25 positons to the full set.  In this way 
each helped complete the project and demonstrated ownership of the book.  If 
you chose to pass this collection to someone else please verify that they 
own the book.  The best way is to ask for a random set of 25 positions.  
Please do not distribute this freely by posting it on a website.  Polgár 
has given us a wonderful resource for tactical study, lets not discourage 
him from doing it again.  Thanks to everyone who made this possible. } 1-0
