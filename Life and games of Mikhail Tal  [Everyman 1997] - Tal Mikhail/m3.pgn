1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Nbd7 {Up till 1962, this
variation was not especially popular, and was adopted only rarely in those
cases when Black very much wanted a draw. In the Candidates Tournament at
Curaçao, Petrosian played this variation against me in round eight, as did
Benko two rounds later.} ({In the game with Petrosian after} 5... Nbd7 {, I
played} 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. Nf3 c5 {and after an hour's thought chose the
absolutely unique plan of} 8. Qd3 Be7 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Qb5+ {. White naturally
lost very quickly. The game with Benko developed more normally, but during the
game with Portisch I could not recall the exact order of moves (up till now I
have fairly successfully endeavoured to forget all the games which I played at
Curaçao).}) 6. Nxf6+ {Probably the most accurate.} ({After} 6. Nf3 Be7 {Black
succeeds in simplifying the position, since on} 7. Nxf6+ {,} Bxf6 {is possible.
}) 6... Nxf6 7. Nf3 c5 8. Bc4 {I think that it is in this way, without trying
to refute Black's opening, that White reaches the most promising position.} ({
Attempts to force matters by} 8. Ne5) ({or} 8. Bb5+ {do not achieve anything
real against accurate defence.}) 8... cxd4 9. O-O Be7 10. Qe2 h6 {Black's
desire to rid himself of the bishop on g5 is understandable, but in the future
the pawn on h6 will draw the attention of the white pieces directed against
Black's kingside. h6 is a very convenient square on which to sacrifice.} (10...
O-O 11. Rad1 Nd5 12. Bxe7 Nxe7 {was more in the spirit of the variation, when
Black's knight can follow his white opponent: against Ne5 there can follow ...Ng6, while with the white knight on d4 Black can play ...Nc6. In positions of
this type the exchange of knights is to the advantage of the defending side.})
11. Bf4 O-O 12. Rad1 Bd7 13. Rxd4 {White thought for about half an hour over
this move.} ({It was difficult to decide which was stronger: the openly
aggressive move in the game, or the more reserved} 13. Nxd4 {after which White
could play his rook along the third rank without loss of time. In nearly all
variations White's attack would develop absolutely unhindered. What didn't
much appeal to me was the fact that Black could reply} Nd5 14. Be5 Bf6 15. Bxd5
exd5 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 {and although White has an undisputed positional advantage,
it may prove insufficient to win. White can easily obtain three quarters of a
point, but after a defeat one wants more.}) 13... Qb6 14. Qd2 $1 {It was with
this continuation in mind that White decided on his previous move - to capture
the pawn with his rook. I did not consider any other moves.} ({Therefore, I
was most astonished when after the game Portisch told me that only here had we
diverged from the path of the Tal-Benko game, where White had chosen the
ridiculous, in my (present) opinion, continuation} 14. Rd3 {. It is not
surprising that here, having come up against an innovation, Portisch thought
for about forty minutes.}) 14... Bc6 ({Black could also defend his bishop, and
meet the coming bishop sacrifice, by} 14... Rfc8 {.} 15. -- ({Against this I
was intending to examine once again the sharp variation} 15. Bxh6 gxh6 16. Qxh6
Qxd4 17. Nxd4 Rxc4 18. Rd1 {, with dangerous threats}) ({and if this proved
insufficient I had in reserve the unpretentious retreat} 15. Bb3 {, keeping an
attractive position. After the text, White's reply is practically forced,
otherwise the move 14 Qd2 is simply a waste of time.})) 15. Bxh6 Ne4 {The only
move.} ({In case of} 15... gxh6 {White continues his attack by means of} 16.
Qxh6 -- ({, and now on} 16... Bxf3 {, decisive is} 17. Qg5+ Kh8 18. Rh4+ Nh7 ({
or} 18... Bh5 19. Bd3 {with the irresistible threat of 20 Rxh5+}) 19. Qxe7 {
when} Rg8 {fails to} 20. Qf6+ {.}) (16... Ne4 {is answered very strongly by}
17. Bd3 {.})) ({If Black changes the move order by playing} 15... Bxf3 {, then
if he wishes White can transpose into the variation already considered by} 16.
Bxg7 {.} ({Besides this, the simple} 16. gxf3 gxh6 17. Kh1 {is also not bad.}))
16. Qf4 gxh6 17. Rxe4 {This gives the game rather a different direction. In
return for the sacrificed exchange White counts on keeping a persistent
initiative.} ({The attempt to force matters by} 17. Qxh6 -- ({achieves its
goal after} 17... Bc5 18. Ng5 $1) (17... Rfd8 18. Bxe6 $1) ({or} 17... Qc5 18.
Bd3) ({but after the only move} 17... Rad8 $1 {, keeping the f7-square
defended, White has nothing better than to force a draw by perpetual check:}
18. Bxe6 Rxd4 19. Bf5 Nf6 20. Qg5+ {.})) 17... Bxe4 18. Qxe4 {Here Portisch
once again thought for a considerable time. He has on his side a minimal
advantage in material - the exchange for a pawn - but the exposed position of
his king and (once again) the presence of opposite-coloured bishops calls on
him to be extra-careful.} ({Thus after} 18. Qxe4 {,} Qxb2 {loses almost
immediately to} 19. Ne5 $1 {, when it is impossible to defend against the
various sacrifices on e6 and f7 (} Bf6 20. Bd3 {).}) ({I thought that the best
defensive resource after} 18. Qxe4 {was} Bf6 19. Bd3 Rfd8 20. Qh7+ Kf8 21.
Qxh6+ Ke7 ({weaker is} 21... Bg7 22. Qf4 ({or} 22. Qh5)) 22. b3 {, but here
White already has two pawns for the exchange, while his initiative shows no
signs of diminishing. Portisch attempts to include his rook in the defence.})
18... Rad8 $1 19. b3 ({The prospect of re-establishing material equality by} 
19. Bd3 Rxd3 {and 20...Qxb2 did not appear good enough.}) 19... Bc5 {Now the
idea behind Black's defence is revealed. First of all, he restricts White's
rook for the moment by attacking the point f2. He plans for the black bishop
to take part in the defence via the square d4. The following manoeuvre by
White is aimed at further weakening Black's kingside. It involves the
calculation of a long variation, a calculation which, unfortunately, is
inaccurate. Meanwhile, by continuing simply c3, White could have maintained
all the advantages of his position, and Black's defence would have involved
great difficulties. White's oversight is, however, rather amusing.} 20. Qf4 Kg7
21. Qe5+ {This forces the advance of the pawn, since it is hopeless to allow
the queen in on f6.} f6 22. Qg3+ {White naturally did not even consider
capturing on e6.} Kh7 23. Re1 Rg8 (23... Rd6 {would lose to} 24. Nh4 Rg8 25.
Bd3+ f5 26. Bxf5+ $1 {. This was White's idea - to free the square e7 for his
rook. --- Nunn: I do not see White's continuation if Black simply takes the
bishop.}) ({However, Black had at his disposal a very interesting defensive
possibility:} 23... Bb4 {. I had taken this into account, and had prepared a
winning variation, or so I thought:} 24. Bxe6 Bxe1 25. Bf5+ Kh8 26. Qg6 Bxf2+ (
{if} 26... Qxf2+ {, then} 27. Kh1 Qf1+ 28. Ng1) 27. Kf1 Rd1+ 28. Ke2 Qe3+ 29.
Kxd1 {.}) ({While Portisch was thinking over his move, White to his horror
ascertained that, by playing, after} 23... Bb4 24. Bxe6 Bxe1 25. Bf5+ Kh8 26.
Qg6 Bxf2+ 27. Kf1 Rd1+ 28. Ke2 {,} Re1+ {, Black would be the first to mate.})
({White would probably have had to move his rook, or else after} 23... Bb4 {,
force a draw by} 24. c3 Bxc3 ({Nunn: Black should play} 24... Rg8 {, and only
then ...Bxc3}) 25. Nh4 Bxe1 26. Qg6+ {. --- After the mistake committed by
Black, White's attack gains in strength with every move.}) 24. Qh4 Rd6 25. Kf1
{I do not feel inclined to attach a question mark to this move. It appears
completely logical. White frees his queen from the defence of his f-pawn,
since nothing is gained by capturing it without check.} ({But here White had
at his disposal a fine opportunity to gain a decisive advantage, by playing} 
25. c3 a5 26. a3 $3 {(Koblents pointed out this possibility straight away
after the game). Now, in view of the threat of 27 b4, Black is forced to move
either his queen or his rook, but then White captures one of the pawns (on e6
or f6) with decisive effect.} -- ({For example:} 26... Rc6 27. Qxf6 Bxf2+ 28.

position. It is extremely difficult for Black to defend against the numerous
threats, especially when in severe time-trouble.})) 25... f5 26. h3 {Preparing
for the g-pawn to come into play in the role of a battering-ram.} Rg6 ({Perhaps
} 26... Qc6 {, which prevents White's next move, would have enabled Black to
hold out longer. Even then, by continuing} 27. Qf6 {, White would keep all the
advantages of his position.}) 27. g4 $1 {This destroys, once and for all, the
black king's shelter.} ({Black gains nothing by} 27. g4 fxg4 28. hxg4 Qc6 {
because of the simple} 29. Ne5 {, when he does not have a single check.}) ({
After} 27. g4 {the best defence was perhaps the immediate} Qc6 28. gxf5 Qxf3

move made by Portisch loses immediately.}) 27... Rd7 28. Rxe6 $1 ({It was
still possible to fall into a trap:} 28. Bxe6 $2 Bxf2 $1 {and Black succeeds
in simplifying the position. Now it is all over.}) 28... Rd1+ 29. Kg2 Rxe6 30.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O d6 {With his third move the Danish
Grandmaster set White a problem: he had to decide which system to play. With
his fourth move, however, Black himself answers this question. In this game he
is attracted by a system which was very popular among the great players of the
past: Steinitz, Lasker and Capablanca. Nowadays it does not enjoy such fame.
Black obtains a cramped but solid position, which today, when the striving is
for more active defensive possibilities, is thought unfashionable.} 5. d4 Bd7

in this position is a mystery, I think, not only to me.} 8. -- ({In any case,

Shamkovich, in which it was stated that the strong continuation} 8. Bxc6 bxc6

several attractive attacking possibilities.}) 13... O-O 14. Rad1 Re8 ({In
similar positions it is considered safest for Black to play} 14... Bxc3 {, but
then White has a definite, though not decisive, advantage.}) 15. Rfe1 Nb6 {
Black is able to develop his forces fairly harmoniously thanks to the position
of the white queen on d2. Thus if the queen had stood on d3 or e3, 15 Nd5

clear - a lead in development, and Black's difficulty in evacuating his king -

Black's 18th move), reinforced the conviction that to refrain from such a

{After an absence of more than a year from tournament play (this time had been
spent playing matches) it was 1966 when I set off for Sarajevo. I have already
said that I play with particular pleasure in Yugoslavia, and with success, and
the traditional Sarajevo Tournament was no exception. --- I do not recall what
it was that held me up, but I was somewhat delayed in leaving Moscow, and I
flew out to Yugoslavia in the same plane as our footballers. Petar Smederavac,
my son's godfather, was due to meet me at the airport (immediately after my
match with Larsen he had got married, and I had been a witness at the wedding),
but he was a few minutes late, and the Soviet footballers introduced me to
their Yugoslav colleagues as... the Soviet team masseur. Then Petar appeared,
took me away in another car, and the footballers were 'orphaned'.} 1. -- {
Right from the start in Sarajevo, I played several interesting games,
including one with Damjanovic, against whom I held a grudge. The point was
that, during the match with Spassky, Mata had also been playing in Tbilisi,
in an International Tournament, and in an interview had characterised me as
follows: 'Tal plays the opening like a good Grandmaster, the middle game
better than a good Grandmaster, and the endgame like an ordinary master'. Such
a formulation very much displeased me, and you will understand that it was
with great pleasure that I exchanged queens in our game, especially since the
resulting ending was clearly in my favour. --- This tournament also saw the
continuation of my duel with Spassky, this time, of course, by proxy. The
Czech master Jansa, who was both a friend and an admirer of Boris, chose
against me that same variation of the Ruy Lopez, in principle favourable for
White, which had nevertheless caused me so much trouble in the 9th game with
Spassky. In a very sharp position Jansa offered me a draw and in reply I
immediately blundered and lost. Then there was a very amusing episode in my
game with Matulovic, who completely fits the description of me given above by
Damjanovic. In a slightly favourable rook ending I occupied the only open file
with my rook, expecting Matulovic to do the same. Then, however, Black would
have been left with a very slightly better pawn ending, which would have been
quite impossible to win. The Yugoslav did not place his rook on the open file
either straight away, or at any time that it was possible. Thus the file
remained in my hands for ever, my advantage increased, and in the end I won.
To the question, why had he not exchanged rooks, Matulovic gave a quite
unexpected reply: 'I haven't yet studied pawn endings!'} *

then resign.} (25. -- {After ten rounds I was trailing the leader, the
Yugoslav player Ciric, by 1½ points! The future Grandmaster, usually so
peaceable, was thirsting for a fight in Sarajevo. He had scored eight wins,
one defeat, and only one draw! --- We met in the 11th round, and the previous
day I had read in a sports paper a somewhat flowery compliment addressed by
him to me. In an interview, Ciric had said that he thought he had good chances
of first place, and that if Spassky had been playing instead of Tal, he would
consider his victory already assured, whereas, as it was, everything was not
yet clear. --- I did my best to confirm his fears, and won our game. There was
an amusing finish to it. For this encounter, apart from the normal fans with a
good understanding of chess, many sports fans arrived. In the time-scramble,
with the demonstrators somewhat behind the players, Ciric obtained a second
queen on the 39th move, but resigned on the 40th, and shook my hand. On seeing
the handshake and the two black queens on the board, the less experienced
spectators shouted 'Bravo, Cira!', while at the same time the more qualified
section of the public was shouting 'Bravo, Tal!' They were all quietened by
the demonstrator who hung up on the board the sign 'White won'. --- Thus, when
the last round began, we found ourselves level, and that is how we finished.
--- Once again there came a break in my chess life. It was due to the fact
that, after a 3-year interval, my diseased kidney made itself felt, and also
that there took place in Moscow the match for the World Championship, at which
I once again fulfilled my duties as a journalist. In short, it was only in the
autumn that I once again sat down at the board. --- I began the Kislovodsk
Tournament with a defeat at the hands of the Moldavian master Lutikov, but
then my fortunes sharply improved until my kidney began playing up. For
several days, the question of my leaving the tournament was debated, but I
decided to play on to the end, thinking that there was no reason why the
talented Lutikov, similar to me in his chess convictions, should suffer
because of me. I dissipated the whole of my plus score, and finished only on
the 50% mark. --- It was therefore not without some apprehension that I began
my next tournament. All the time I was haunted by the thought: what if my
illness should make itself felt during the Team Championship of the Country
for Sports Societies. I could not avoid taking part: the tournament on the top
board would be extremely strong, and Botvinnik would be playing there. After
declining to play in the Candidates Matches the previous year, he was pretty
'hungry', and played with great enthusiasm.}) (25. -- {JOURNALIST. The joke
was made that, in this team tournament, all the World Championship Matches of
recent years were continued. --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, on the top board the
following games took place: Botvinnik-Smyslov, Botvinnik-Tal,
Botvinnik-Petrosian, Petrosian-Spassky, as well as matches from the Candidates
Cycle: Spassky-Tal and Spassky-Keres. --- Prior to the last round I had
succeeded in winning just one game, though I had not suffered any defeats.
Then I faced the leader, Botvinnik. After it, the score in my games with
Mikhail Moiseyevich was finally levelled: after all, I had won the first match
against him by 4 points, but had lost the return by 5; in this game I first
won a theoretical duel, then a pawn, and in the adjourned position my material
advantage had risen three-fold. --- Besides our game, there were two other
games from the match unfinished, including one on a ladies' board in a very
complicated position. After glancing at the Tal-Botvinnik game, the team
trainer and I spent two whole nights analysing the ladies' adjourned position.
In the morning, we woke our lady player, quickly showed her the results of our
night-long analysis, and set off for the tournament hall. --- The adjourned
games were resumed. That evening the deciding match of the final round was due
to be held, in which Botvinnik would play Petrosian. Without any ulterior
motive, I went up to a representative of the 'Trud' team - Botvinnik's team -
and expressed my sincere admiration for the play of their constant leader.}) (
25. -- {The representative's reaction stunned me: 'Then agree a draw with
Botvinnik, and we will agree to a draw on the ladies' board, where we stand
better!' --- I was taken aback, and I didn't know what to reply. The
representative immediately went up to Botvinnik, who was thinking over his
move, and said something to him. The latter raised his head, waved the
representative away, and stopped his clock in a sign of resignation. In the
end Geller was the winner on the leaders' board, and we three - Botvinnik,
Petrosian and I - finished half a point behind. --- The end of the year was
crowded with events, but began in an unpleasant way. At the Olympiad in Havana
an unknown man 'caught' me with a 'tactical blow': a bottle to the head. As a
result, the 'first game' of the Olympiad, Tal-N.N., ended in my defeat, close
to a rout. --- However, this only led to my missing the first four rounds, in
which we played against Morocco and India, and in which I might have hoped to
improve my individual score. Perhaps this shock even had a beneficial effect
on me, just like the operation for appendicitis in 1959, for I played with
great enthusiasm. Despite missing the first four rounds, and the final one, I
nevertheless played more games than the other members of our team. As many as
three of the games played in Havana are given here, and of these the encounter
with Robert Byrne was of special significance. As is well known, the Soviet
team did not want to be given four points by default against the Americans,
who did not turn up to play*[Editor's note: The match had originally been
scheduled for a day on which Fischer could not play (for religious reasons),
and rather than play without their first board, the USA team did not appear
for the match.], and with our agreement the match was set for another day. It
was my game with Byrne that decided its fate. --- Before the last round, when
the success of our team was already assured, I was allowed by our captain to
fly out a little earlier than my colleagues: I was to be one of the first
Soviet players to participate in a tournament in Spain, in Palma de Mallorca.
--- I began, as if by inertia after Havana, in very lively style, and at the
start scored something like 5 out of 5. The Spaniard Arturo Pomar was also
playing well. Earlier I had read a lot about him, almost the only pupil of
Alekhine. I considered my most important game to be the one against Trifunovic,
the only player in the tournament with a plus score against me (see the
following game).}) 1-0

Pomar, driving him into the arena. Perhaps this defeat, not so much physical
as moral, affected Pomar, for the following day he lost, fully opening the way
for me to first place.} (57. -- {JOURNALIST. But you, after all, also went
into the arena! Tell me, please; if in Havana the 'additional game' with N.N.
had occurred accidentally, why in Mallorca was it necessary to play a similar
'game' with a real live bull? --- CHESS PLAYER. Firstly, it was really more
like a calf. Secondly, I had heard so much about the bull-fight - from Bizet
to Hemingway - that it would be unthinkable to decline to take part in one in
such convenient circumstances. True, at that moment, I wasn't to know that the
following morning the local papers would display our photograph (that of the
calf and me) with the headline: 'The first Soviet bull-fighter in Spain!'
Three draws at the end of the tournament gave me first place. The year 1966
was over. --- The New Year found me in Tbilisi, once again in the role of
correspondent, at the USSR Championship. Since it was a Zonal Tournament, and
since I already had the right to play in the Candidates cycle, I considered
that it would be somewhat awkward for me to play, since to some extent I could
influence the distribution of the places, involuntarily fulfilling the role of
'controller'. --- In the spring my kidney once again began playing up, and I
went into the well-known Botkin hospital in Moscow. The observations turned
out to be so lengthy that from there, to put it bluntly, I did a bunk, since
there was the pleasant prospect of playing in a very strong International
Tournament in Moscow, dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of the Great October
Revolution. Starved of chess, I began fairly successfully, with wins over
Filip and Bilek (the combination in which was judged to be the most brilliant
in the tournament). Both these games are given here. Then, against Gligoric, I
got the order of moves wrong, and so did not win a piece, nor the game. For a
long time after this I was unsettled, not so much by the lost half point, as
by the missing of a simple tactical possibility. A draw with Gipslis followed,
then an incorrect sacrifice against Keres, simply refuted, and several more
draws. --- Only in the second half of the tournament did things go somewhat
better for me. The game that I won against Petrosian is given here; I defeated
the World Champion for the first time after a 10-year interval. I also gained
my first win against Bronstein for a long time, and defeated Uhlmann in an
amusing struggle. --- At one point the East German Grandmaster thought for so
long that my colleague Gipslis, who had already finished his game, went off to
hear The Barber of Seville, but was disappointed by the performance, and left
after the first act, and once again made for the tournament hall. To his
amazement, he found Uhlmann still thinking over the same move! His meditation
lasted for 1 hour 40 minutes! I would have laughed if at that time anyone had
said to me that in our next game Uhlmann would beat this record, but that's
just what happened: Uhlmann thought for 1 hour 50 minutes!! I suffered one
more defeat, playing the King's Indian Defence most unsuccessfully against
Portisch, and as a result shared 2nd-5th places with Smyslov, Bobotsov and
Gipslis. The winner was Leonid Stein. --- My next event, the Team Tournament
of the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad, was also in Moscow. Latvia found itself in a
strong preliminary group, from which we only reached the second final group. I
scored 6 points out of 9, without defeat, and played several interesting games.

{I have already said that with Yugoslav players I have the most warm and
friendly relations, but this does not prevent us from fighting desperately at
the chessboard. Now I played for the first time in the traditional
USSR-Yugoslavia Match, which has been held regularly since 1956. It was in
1967 that, for the only time, the match was made into a tournament of 12
players, 6 from each country. It is still with a smile that in the press I
read references such as 'in the game Tal-Gipslis from the USSR-Yugoslavia
Match, 1967 ...' --- In the first round I played Gligoric, adopting the same
variation as in the Moscow Tournament a few months earlier, the variation over
which such a discussion was to flare up between us in the Candidates Match a
year later. Then came a draw with Korchnoi, who set an exceptional pace, and
as a result outstripped his closest rivals - Gligoric and myself - by one and
a half points. --- Then, after a lengthy stay in hospital, this time in Riga,
I played two games with my old friend Victor Ciocaltea in the equally
traditional match between Latvia and Rumania. After this came the Championship
of the Soviet Union in Kharkov. It was the first and, God grant, the last
experiment of running the USSR Championship on the Swiss System. After all,
the overwhelming majority of the players who gathered in Kharkov (and there
were more than a hundred) played interesting chess, but were not serious
contenders for the gold medal. No arguments in favour of the system - the
greater number of participants, a school for the young, etc. - can hide its
main drawback: the influence of Lady Luck. I began with three wins. Then came
a slight setback of several draws, but one of them was judged to be the most
brilliant game of the Championship, and both players received a special prize.

{The first of the decisive games in the Championship proved to be the
encounter with Grandmaster Vasiukov, who played some interesting chess in
Kharkov. This game is given in the book. --- The second key moment in the
Championship was my game against Polugaevsky in the penultimate round. We were
leading with the same number of points, and when, after 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4, I
played 2...e6, Lev offered me a draw. I accepted, although for decency's sake
we made a further 12 moves or so, and the question of first place was put off
until the last round. --- By the luck of the draw, Polugaevsky, much to his
displeasure, had to play Grandmaster Kholmov, whom up till then he had never
beaten. My opponent was to be my compatriot Zhuravlev: a master from Liepay
who, as it happened, I had never played before. The piquancy of the situation
was increased by the fact that should Zhuravlev win, although he had never
qualified for even a USSR Championship semi-final, he would become a
Grandmaster of the Soviet Union! --- Polugaevsky was very upset by the result
of the draw, and I took great pleasure in teasing Lev, 'confidentially'
informing him that in Riga an urgent meeting of the Chess Federation was being
held in order to decide the question: did Latvia want a USSR Champion, or a
new Grandmaster. That evening I went into Polugaevsky's room, and informed him
that the Federation had decided the question in favour of the USSR Champion.
--- Of course, of this 'meeting' and 'decision' of the Latvian Chess
Federation, Zhuravlev knew nothing. --- The following day, having completely
pulled himself together, Polugaevsky scored a clear-cut win over Kholmov,

{The following year, 1968, brought me few laurels, and it all started in
January, at the traditional tournament in Wijk aan Zee. I played there with
Korchnoi, and the Leningrad player once again set a furious pace, scoring 6½ out of 7 at the start.
From my first games I felt that I had neither the
enthusiasm, nor the right sort of mood, for chess. --- From the whole
tournament there were only two games that I could boast about. The game
against Donner is given here in this book, and this is the other:} 24... Rca8

start of the Candidates matches, and showed that, to put it mildly, I was not
in my best form. This was also confirmed by the start of my match with
Gligoric. In preparing for this encounter, Koblents and I realised that a duel
was likely to develop in one or more topical opening schemes, since the
theoretical preparation of the Yugoslav Grandmaster has always been notable
for its thoroughness and soundness. --- There was no discussion about where
the match should be held: I readily agreed to play on my opponent's 'home
ground' in Belgrade.} 0-1

{In the first game I had the white pieces, and at the start I was
subconsciously unwilling to reveal my secret weapon immediately. On the other
hand, success would mean the immediate destruction of Gligoric's favourite and
main defence against 1 e4. The second consideration outweighed, and after
spending some three minutes on the opening, I made the preparatory move} 22.
Ra3 {(In the overcrowded hall of the Palace of Syndicates, where we were
playing, the noise level rose: whether it was a joke or not, the rook had
placed itself en prise to the black bishop. Gligoric sank into thought, and
after 40 minutes found the correct way to neutralise White's innovation.)} bxa4
23. Rxa4 Rab8 {. Subsequently I could have obtained an ending with an extra
pawn, but this would have been practically equivalent to agreeing a draw.
Preferring a sharp game, I avoided this, then at some point blundered, and in
the adjourned position Gligoric found a precise way to win. --- The second
game again featured a theoretical duel, this time in the Nimzo-Indian Defence
where we had prepared an improvement in Gligoric's favourite variation. As a
result, Gligoric immediately offered a draw as White, but I had to try to win
one back and began attempting to obtain more from the position than was
justified. Suddenly I saw for White an excellent combination (however,
analysis later showed it to be incorrect). To avoid it, I moved my knight away
from the centre, and nervously offered a draw myself, but the advantage was
now with Gligoric. Only in the time-scramble did I manage to win the exchange,
which, however, did not give any real winning chances. The following day, when
the game was to be resumed, there was an important international football
match in Belgrade, which was clearly not worth missing for the sake of such a
position. --- So, after agreeing to a draw, Gligoric and I went together
amicably to the match between Yugoslavia and France.} (23... -- {In the third
game another misfortune befell me, and rather an amusing one. In preparing for
the match, we knew that in reply to 1 d4 Gligoric played the King's Indian
Defence 90 times out of 100, and I decided to playa system often chosen by
Larsen. It was only when I played it that I immediately remembered that I had
already adopted the same variation as Black against lvkov at Bled, in 1961,
when Gligoric was present. The Yugoslav naturally neutralised my whole set-up,
and in a slightly superior position offered a draw. --- Only the fourth game
gave me a certain cause for optimism. I once again won the theoretical duel
in the Nimzo-Indian Defence, and this time, with the slightly better game, I
offered a draw 'from a position of strength'. For almost the first time in my
life, the sober voice of reason suggested that for the moment it was not worth
declining draws, but was better to get into form and attempt to decide the
match in the 3rd, 4th, and should the opportunity arise, 5th 'White' games.
--- But nothing came of the 5th game, and many of the reporters in the
Yugoslav press began to express their preference for Gligoric. They said that
he had a point in hand, that he had three 'White' games to come against my two,
and that he was fit and well prepared physically. However, I sensed that I was
'beginning to play', and felt that in the fifth game I had seen quite a lot at
the board. --- Gligoric, meanwhile, was in something of a dilemma. On the one
hand he realised that it would be good to increase his advantage with a win,
but on the other hand he began playing with an extra degree of caution, so as
to maintain that which had already been achieved. This indecision only
hindered him. At any rate, in the sixth game he played inconsistently, making
first a safe move, and then an active one. It is not impossible that Gligoric
was disturbed by my playing an opening which I had never played before. Be
that as it may, the score in the match was levelled, and besides, I had
noticed earlier that Gligoric before a defeat, and Gligoric after one are two
entirely different players. --- This was also confirmed in our match. In the
seventh game I held the initiative, and managed to take the lead, so that both
the score, and the mood of the opponents, had changed in my favour.}) (23... --
{Gligoric had two 'White' games remaining, and here my sense of danger came
into operation, though when it arose in me I do not know. In the eighth game I
decided to avoid repeating the variation with which I had twice been
successful. --- With what was I to replace it? I decided to 'borrow' from
Larsen, who at that time was playing his match with Portisch in Zagreb, 
(incidentally, late every evening we would watch on television both a
commentary on my game with Gligoric, and a description of the game between the
Dane and the Hungarian) and chose the variation which he was adopting in the
Nimzo-Indian Defence. --- The decision proved to be a correct one, since later
Gligoric told me that it was before the 8th game that he and Velimirovic had
found an important improvement, which effectively put out of business the
variation which I had played in the 2nd and 4th games. The fact that I myself
diverged noticeably distressed the Yugoslav Grandmaster. I quickly obtained at
least an equal game, but despite having the better prospects, offered a draw,
since I very much wanted to be in time to watch the televising of the football
match between the USSR and Hungary. Gligoric thought for some 25-30 minutes,
until midway through the first half, and declined. I felt just a little bit
angry, but even so, when within 5 or 6 moves Gligoric in turn offered a draw,
I did not try to gain revenge for the missed football: besides, I sensed that
Svetozar had already cracked.}) *

{Indeed, the following game, the 9th, turned out to be the last. In it I
adopted the move order chosen by Korchnoi in the 2nd game of his match with
Reshevsky, which was proceeding at the same time in Amsterdam. I did not, of
course, expect Gligoric to blunder away a pawn, as Reshevsky had done, but
this almost happened. --- True, at the last moment Gligoric realised the
danger, but he was able to ward it off only at the cost of two tempi. They
proved sufficient for the game to be adjourned in a position which, although
complicated, saw White the exchange ahead: A lively and highly significant
part in the analysis of the adjourned position was played by the world-famous
violinist David Oistrakh, an old and faithful lover of chess, who had arrived
in Yugoslavia for a concert. Incidentally, the analysis was quite complicated,
and we analysed the position roughly 18 moves ahead, avoiding a number of
false paths. It was the main variation of our analysis that occurred in the

{The resumption therefore proceeded at practically lightning speed. The match
concluded and I set off to visit Petar Smederavac, my son's godfather. Just on
my arrival in Yugoslavia, a daughter had been born to him, and I became her
godfather. Petar gave the baby the name of Talija. --- I returned to Moscow,
and exactly half an hour later Victor Korchnoi, who was to be my opponent in
the Candidates Semi-final Match, flew in from Amsterdam, where he had beaten
Reshevsky. --- In our match, the Leningrad Grandmaster was considered by chess
correspondents to be the undisputed favourite. The score of our previous
encounters appeared in the press, and it was recalled that, in the last
tournament where we had both participated (Wijk aan Zee), Korchnoi had
finished 3 points ahead of me. I was confronted by the following problems:
firstly, to make myself forget about our previous games, and secondly, to
force myself to playas reservedly as possible, since Korchnoi is at his most
dangerous in positions of a counter-attacking type, and feels less confident
in situations where he himself has to take the initiative. --- Therefore we
decided at the start of the match to give preference to 1 d4, since previously
I had always opened with my king's pawn against him. --- The very first game
fully confirmed all our expectations. I began extra-calmly, then came
simplification, and straight from the opening the game went into an ending
which I could not have lost if I had tried. Korchnoi could have gained
approximate equality, but he was completely discouraged by the way the game
had gone, and made two anti-positional moves. A pawn ending was reached which
was lost for him, although this still had to be proved. --- Here I wrongly
made the mistake of not believing myself. At first I wrote down the winning
move} 28. e5 {, but then decided to work out all the variations literally to
mate. To do this proved not at all easy. It was only several days later that a
detailed analysis appeared, confirming that, by avoiding many false paths,
White could win by force. Being unable to find all this at the board, I
rejected 28 e5, subsequently again played inaccurately, and Korchnoi found the
only moves to force a draw.} (28. -- {The most amusing thing is that I was not
at all upset: the game had shown that the match tactics we had planned were
quite correct. --- In the second game I again avoided all the sharp
continuations into which my opponent tried to provoke me, and in the third
game once again chose the quiet opening variation which had been
psychologically so unpleasant for Korchnoi in the first game. Here, and this
doesn't happen often, my opponent fell into a prepared opening trap, and I
obtained a completely won position with an extra pawn. I allowed myself to
relax a little, which you can't afford to do against Korchnoi, and first made
my task more complicated, and then in time-trouble lost all my advantage. ---
I realised that there was no cause for panic, and that this game would have
played on Korchnoi's nerves no less than on mine, but my heart began to be
tormented by doubts: one game I had not won, now a second. I was already
somewhat softened up when I arrived for the next game. --- Korchnoi very
keenly sensed this, played the first part of the game very energetically,
adopting an interesting theoretical innovation and obtained a clearly superior,
if not winning position. In addition, I was also dispirited by the fact that
over the first 15 moves I had spent a mass of time, and Korchnoi practically
none. --- To avoid the worst I decided to get some play at the cost of a pawn,
which, of course, Korchnoi should not have taken, but a recurrence of his old
illness - a tendency to capture pawns of 'any quality' - almost allowed me to
save the game. --- For the pawn Black's pieces came strongly into play, and
only severe time-trouble 'led' me past a continuation which would have made
Korchnoi fight for the draw. However, I blundered, lost a piece and the game.})
(28. -- {My good intentions were immediately abandoned, and after a lengthy
discussion with my second, I decided to return to my old ways, and play 1 e4,
although it had previously been unsuccessful against Korchnoi. In reply to
this, Korchnoi chose a quiet variation of the Ruy Lopez, which he had played
only rarely, promising White an active and superior game. I did not play the
best way, and Korchnoi practically equalised. Of course, if I had not been
burdened by the thought of my loss in the fourth game, and the chances missed
earlier, I would have gone in for the quiet position planned by Black, but my
nervous decision, taken on the spot, gave Korchnoi the chance to shine with a
typical counter-attack. --- Everything seemed to be settled. By tradition, the
match against Korchnoi was lost, for I would never make up the difference of
two points in the remaining five games, in three of which I would have Black,
and I went along quite calmly to the sixth game. Korchnoi evidently considered
even three draws to be a luxury for me, and went all out to 'finish me off'.
Indeed, he obtained the better position, while I was once again in
time-trouble, and took my only chance: to sacrifice the exchange for a pawn.
The position became considerably sharper, but Korchnoi was evidently
unprepared for such a change, and when the time control had been reached it
was clear that, despite being the exchange ahead, White was lost. --- The fate
of the match once more hung in the balance, and Korchnoi's self-confidence was
markedly shaken. In the last games of the match he tended,
uncharacteristically, to aim only for a draw. It became easier for me to play
in such a situation, but not once was I able to realise any advantage I gained.

saying what he did not mean. However, I found it amusing how he expressed his
dissatisfaction, when a couple of months later I turned up as correspondent

annoying defeats in a row against Platonov, who had started badly, and my
compatriot Klovans. --- I naturally fell out of the leading group, and then
began my second ascent. Several games went successfully, including the one
with Gurgenidze given in the book, and some six rounds before the finish the
distance between myself and the leaders had been reduced to a minimum. Taking
into account the fact that I had a not especially difficult finish, there was
even hope for complete success. --- Just at this point came a recurrence of my
illness, which had not left me, apart from short intervals, for the whole of
1968. The consequence was that, for the first time in my life, I scored only
1½ points out of 5 at the finish, and it should have been even less. --- The
result was my worst failure up till then in the Championship of my country.
--- In addition, I had no suspicion of what was awaiting me in the following
Zonal Championship that same year.} 1-0

{After the Championship I had once again to return to matches, and to meet
Bent Larsen, who had lost in the other Candidates semi-final Match. The winner
of our 'consolation' duel would have the right to compete in the next
Interzonal Tournament. --- At that point I felt so terrible that, for the
first time in my life, I appealed to the Soviet Chess Federation with a
request that the match be postponed. Our chess leaders reacted to this
suggestion extremely reservedly. It was in their interests that the match with
Larsen should be concluded before the start of the USSR Championship
semi-finals, since in the event of my losing, I would have to start the new
cycle for the crown in one of these semi-finals. Formally, I was assured that
everything possible would be done, but the leaders of our Federation were
'unable' to find Larsen, who at that time was playing a match with Westerinen
in Helsinki, and the match began on the date set previously. When I asked
Larsen whether he would have been prepared to postpone the match, he said
without thinking: 'Of course! My wife gave my telephone number in Helsinki to
your representative, but no one phoned me ...' --- This match with Larsen was
as bad as our first match had been interesting. --- Larsen is of the same
opinion, so this is by no means just the grumbling of the loser. Of all the
eight games, only the sixth, in which Bent played excellently, is worth
singling out. The remainder of the games abounded in mistakes, most of them by
me. My poor form in the match is best illustrated by the episode which
occurred in the 8th game. --- This position was reached after the black king
had 'taken a walk', and then returned to e8. I had calculated that by
advancing my a-pawn, I would win in a few moves, but suddenly I saw that by
castling (!!) Black could set up a counter-attack: on f2. I therefore began
taking energetic measures to prevent Black from castling... --- After the game,
which I lost, one of the participants in a mass tournament taking place there
came up to me, and asked why I hadn't played} 29. a5 {at the appropriate
moment. I replied, and then stopped short on seeing the glazed eyes of Larsen
and the enquiring fan. Only then did I realise that I had been fighting not
against castling, but against its shadow, and I thought to myself. 'It is just
as well that this was only a prestige game; if it had decided the match, I
would have been near to having a heart attack...' --- Then there came a
month's break in my chess biography, given over to medication. Lying in a Riga
hospital I appeared in the role of chess correspondent on the
Petrosian-Spassky match; I received the games move by move by telephone from
Moscow, and the following morning I dictated my notes on the games to the
Moscow stenographer of the chess weekly 64. I was then taken to Moscow, and
the day for the operation was named. Then I found out that for six to eight
weeks after it I would be confined to bed. Meanwhile the Championship of the
Soviet Union would have started, this year having the status of a Zonal
Tournament, and I decided to put off the operation until later. Nevertheless,
in my condition it proved quite impossible to play, and my colleagues tried
many times to persuade me to leave the tournament, but with my former optimism
I completed it all the same. Although in the lower half of the table most of
the time, in the middle of the tournament I somehow ran into form. I don't
know if it was that my opponents began to under-estimate me, or that my
organism suddenly became accustomed to working, but almost in successive games
I won against Lutikov, and inflicted the first defeat in the tournament on
Kholmov. In addition, Vasiukov lost on time in an equal position, and I began
to think: who knows, if I finish well, I may have chances yet. --- Then, five
rounds before the finish, I had two adjourned games; with a big advantage
against Stein, and an apparently completely won position against Furman. --- I
began to look ahead: for 'Zonal' success, besides these games, I would have to
win towards the end against Gipslis and Averkin. --- The adjourned games were
resumed. Furman found an interesting idea, sacrificed his queen, and we
reached a position where there was perhaps no longer a win. However, there was
very definitely no need for me to lose! I got into time-trouble, messed things
up, and resigned, and then with a complete lack of enthusiasm resumed my game
against Stein, finally drawing with difficulty. --- My overall score was quite
deplorable: for the first time since Curaçao I scored less than fifty per cent.

{The result of this game was of great significance. It was played two rounds
before the finish, when the Moscow Grandmaster was leading the tournament.
Among the chasing group, half a point behind, was his opponent. It should be
stated that, in a theoretical sense (and possibly also in a practical sense),
Vasiukov was prepared for the Championship better than anyone, and it would
appear that a great deal of credit for this must go to... Korchnoi. You may
recall that Vasiukov was Korchnoi's second at the Interzonal Tournament, and
in one of his interviews he wrote roughly the following: 'I hope that in some
way I was able to assist my 'ward'; as for myself, the creative contact with
Korchnoi afforded me great satisfaction, and has brought certain benefits'.
--- I was to sense Korchnoi's influence straight away.} 1. e4 Nf6 {Korchnoi is
one of the few modern Grandmasters who, from time to time, successfully adopts

{'What do you think of the move 3...b5?' --- The Georgian Champion Bukhuti
Gurgenidze has for a long time shown himself to be one of the strongest
masters in the country. It should be mentioned that in his games, as a rule,
the creative element predominates over the practical. Whatever his results in
competitions, he plays a number of interesting games, and in practically every
tournament he tries out at times dubious, at times even paradoxical ideas,
which, however, he upholds with great success. Thus, for instance, against the
Sicilian Defence he adopts as White a most unusual set-up, which at first
provoked only sceptical smiles from his opponents and from theorists. But time
has passed, and it seems that not one of a number of strong opponents has
succeeded in demonstrating that the Georgian master's point of view is
unjustified. --- In the USSR Championship at Alma-Ata, Bukhuti Gurgenidze
adopted an unusual system in the Caro-Kann Defence. It might appear that this
opening has been studied so much in recent years that it is difficult to open
any new page in it. Nevertheless, this is not so; in a number of games in the
Championship, opening discoveries occurred as early as the third move.} 1. e4
c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 b5 {It should be said that the Georgian master adopted the
Caro-Kann Defence in this tournament from the very start. This was a rather
clever idea, because the opening had never previously been included in his
repertoire. Starting with the games in the third and fourth rounds against
Vasiukov and Liberzon, Gurgenidze played the Caro-Kann continually. In both of
the above-mentioned games the Panov attack occurred, and then at last Igor
Zaitsev played 3 Nc3. To the great astonishment of the spectators, the players,
and Gurgenidze's opponent, there followed this outwardly so paradoxical move 3.
..b5. --- Zaitsev, after thinking for quite a long time, played 4 e5 after
which the position became blocked. Zaitsev succeeded in obtaining an advantage,
but then, in analysis, it seems that Gurgenidze found an improvement for Black
(in particular, it is interesting that after 4 e5 he suggests 4...a5). --- On
the day before the game I was chatting with some Georgian masters, and they
half-jokingly asked me 'What do you think of the move 3...b5?' I answered
completely honestly: 'I think it's a horrible move.' When in the game I played
1 e4, I thought that Gurgenidze would believe me, but 3...b5 followed
nevertheless. After thinking for some 20 minutes over my fourth move, I came
to the conclusion that to refute this continuation immediately was not
possible.} 4. a3 ({I also considered} 4. Bd3 b4 5. Nce2 dxe4 6. Bxe4 Nf6 7. Bf3
{but after} g6 {a position is reached in which the advance of the b-pawn
proves its worth.}) 4... dxe4 {Now Black heads for one of the normal
variations.} 5. Nxe4 Bf5 ({This move is evidently not bad, but also possible
was} 5... Nf6 {as occurred in the game Klovans-Gurgenidze a few days later.
After} 6. Nxf6+ exf6 {Black tried to prevent the advance c4 and thus hold back
White's queenside pawn majority.}) ({Now, after} 5... Bf5 {, if White plays
the standard} 6. Ng3 Bg6 7. Nf3 Nd7 {then Black's ...b5 appears highly logical,
since it begins a struggle for the occupation of the central d5-square; when a
knight reaches there it will be no easy matter for White to drive it away by
advancing his d5-pawn. White decided to demonstrate that the advance of the
b-pawn has significantly weakened Black's position, and with a light heart
went in for the sacrifice of a pawn.}) 6. Bd3 Bxe4 ({I don't think that a
detailed analysis is necessary in order to demonstrate the advantages of
White's position after} 6... Qxd4 7. Nf3 Qd8 ({or} 7... Qd5) 8. Qe2 {.}) 7.
Bxe4 Nf6 {Here White once again thought for quite a long time.} (7... Nf6 8.
Bf3 {suggests itself, but after} e6 {it is not altogether clear how the pieces
should be developed. Black will play ...Bd6, ...Qc7, ...0-0 and then at some
point prepare the freeing advance ...e5. At the same time the pressure of
White's bishop along the long diagonal is not particularly effective, while
Black can always reply to a4 with ...b4, thus preventing the opening of lines
on the queenside.}) 8. Bd3 e6 ({But now} 8... Qxd4 {deserved attention:} 9. Nf3
Qd8 10. Qe2 e6 {. White has the initiative and a good position for the pawn,
but it can hardly be said that this is adequate compensation. I must admit the
truth: I made the move 8 Bd3 fairly calmly, since the Georgian master very
much dislikes positions in which, for a minimal material advantage, he has to
conduct a lengthy, painstaking, and relatively cheerless defence. That's the
way it was; after a short reflection Gurgenidze played ...e6. The fianchetto
of Black's bishop was also worth considering. In both cases White has a
certain advantage, but on the basis of this game one cannot, of course, speak
about a refutation of the Georgian master's original system.}) 9. Nf3 Be7 10.
Qe2 {For the moment White did not want to determine the position of his king,
having not lost hope of castling long, since the advance of Black's queenside
pawns appears fairly harmless. At the last minute he decided against this plan,
having decided that in a position with a certain advantage there is no point
in falling in with the opponent's intentions of complicating the game. It was
more accurate to castle straight away, and in answer to Black's castling play
Re1. It later becomes clear that 10 Qe2 loses a tempo.} Nbd7 {Black in turn
refrains from determining the position of his king.} ({In reply to} 10... Nbd7
11. Bd2 {he can play} Qc7 {, and on queenside castling by White, send his own
king over to the queenside. This variation can be continued:} 12. c4 bxc4 13.
Bxc4 Nb6 {, and with the d5-square in his hands Black can look to the future
with reasonable optimism.}) 11. O-O O-O 12. Re1 ({Here I wanted to play} 12.
Ne5 {immediately, but refrained from this move because of the continuation}
Nxe5 13. dxe5 Nd7 {, after which Black intends to exchange off White's active
bishop by ...Nc5.} 14. c3 {, will not do in view of} ({while in answer to} 14.
Rd1 {Black quietly plays} Qc7 {, once again threatening to take on e5}) 14...
Nxe5 {. --- Perhaps even in this case White's position is very slightly
preferable, but of course such simplification was not part of my plan.}) ({I
thought that Black's strongest move here was} 12. Re1 Qc7 {, so as on} 13. Ne5
{once again to play} Nxe5 14. dxe5 Nd7 {, but in this case White has time to
play c3, and on ...Nc5 simply retreats his light-squared bishop. ---
Gurgenidze's 12th move is basically prophylactic in its aims: Black defends
the e6- and f7-squares against possible future sacrifices, and vacates the
f8-square for one of his minor pieces.}) 12... Re8 {Black evidently plans to
play ...Nf8. White prevents this.} 13. Ne5 Nxe5 ({In view of the threat to his
c-pawn this exchange is evidently forced, because on} 13... Qc7 {Black has to
reckon with the sacrifice of the knight on f7, while} 14. Bf4 {also looks
quite strong.}) 14. dxe5 Nd5 (14... Nd7 {would be a mistake, since White has
the strong continuation} 15. Qe4 {winning the c-pawn. After the text, White
again spent a long time thinking, since it was difficult to find the correct
plan of attack. Black's main trump is the impregnable position of his knight
on d5. This is the logical consequence of the idea initiated by his third move.
If White does not succeed in creating any real threats on the kingside, Black
will consolidate his knight's post by ...a5 and ...a4, with a completely
secure position. However, White has no way of starting a direct attack: on 15
Qe4 Black replies simply} g6 {and on} 16. Bh6 {he can play} Bg5 {, while if
the h-pawn advances then Black can straight away capture it.}) 15. Qg4 {With a
threat to which Black does not pay sufficient attention.} ({Here Black should
have played} 15. Qg4 g6 {, after which} 16. h4 {is a pawn sacrifice whose
consequences are not altogether clear.} ({In answer to 15...g6, Gurgenidze was
afraid of} 16. b3 {, after which White drives away the black knight after all.
However, then} a5 {, with the positional threat of ...a4, looks quite good,
since on} 17. c4 {there follows} Nc3 {, and the somewhat exotic position of
the knight, which seriously hinders the activity of the white pieces, cannot
be exploited by White.})) 15... a5 {Gurgenidze played this consistent move...
--- ...but this move turns out to be very bad, since with a similar flank
diversion (but this time aimed against the king) White obtains a marked
advantage.} 16. h4 $1 {White's plan is relatively simple: he intends to play
h5, and then either Bh6 or h6, forcing a weakening of Black's kingside. Black
therefore cannot continue his plan, but must accept the sacrifice.} Bxh4 {Now
play becomes forced to a considerable extent, and a position for which both
players are striving is reached.} 17. g3 Be7 18. Kg2 g6 ({White's task would
perhaps be more difficult after the immediate} 18... Bf8 {so as to keep in
reserve the defensive resource ...f5.} 19. -- ({. Then there would be no point
in White playing} 19. Bg5 {since Black replies} f5 {and succeeds in
entrenching himself.}) ({. However, after 18...Bf8 White would still keep a
dangerous initiative by continuing} 19. Rh1 f5 (19... g6 {leads to the
position in the game}) 20. Qh5 $1 h6 21. Qg6 {and the threat of Rxh6 is very
difficult to meet. The move chosen by Gurgenidze leads to even more unpleasant
consequences for Black.})) 19. Rh1 {The threat is relatively transparent:
White intends to sacrifice his rook on h7, check with his queen on h5, and
then sacrifice another piece on g6, after which his attack is clearly
irresistible.} ({This same move (20 Rxh7) would be the answer to} 19. Rh1 Qc7 {
, for example:} 20. Rxh7 Qxe5 {there is no other move;} ({if} 20... Kxh7 {,

Black has a clever defence,} 21... Ne3+ $1 {, and the position becomes
unexpectedly complicated, since after} 22. fxe3 ({if White plays} 22. Bxe3 {,

{It was now that I realised that in my present state it was impossible for me
to continue living and playing chess. I travelled to Tbilisi, and there they
removed my diseased kidney, which evidently should have been done 2-3 years
earlier. If it is possible to talk at all about renaissance, that was how I
felt when I came round after the operation. On roughly the fifth day, I was
already impatiently awaiting my next tournament. --- It was just at this time
that a rumour began to spread, to the effect that during the operation I had
suffered a complete and final 'defeat'. It reached Yugoslavia, and my friends
from the Moscow 'Mossovyet' Theatre, who were on tour there at that time, were
saddened to read in a number of Yugoslav newspapers of the death of Tal. I
hastened to reassure my friends, quoting them the words of one of the classic
humourists: 'The rumours about my death are greatly exaggerated!'} 1. -- {The
tournament about which I had been dreaming began in Tbilisi roughly a month
after the operation and I played there with particular pleasure. I don't know

{I felt fine, but the doctors nevertheless advised me not to change climate
straight away, but to spend some time in Tbilisi under their observation. At
this time agreement had been reached about the 'Match of the Century', in
which, despite my recent results, I was allotted a fairly high board. Before
the meeting in Belgrade I also found time to take part in the Georgian
Championship, though I had to play hurriedly, sometimes at the rate of two
games per day. I set off to Moscow to prepare for the 'Match of the Century',
not even knowing how the Championship had ended, and only from the weekly 64
did I find out that I had taken first place. It was time for the chess
festival, the 'Match of the Century'. --- Brilliant organisation, the best
players in the world, and a hard struggle. I, for example, was expecting from
force of habit to get the better of Najdorf, since formerly I had always won
as White, whereas when he was White he usually aimed for a draw from the start.
--- On this occasion Najdorf maintained the equilibrium as Black in the first
game. In the second game he offered me a draw in a position where he had
compensation for a pawn minus. In reply I began to play more sharply, and came
under a mating attack. --- The third game is given here, and then in the
fourth round the USSR team played very cautiously, since the day before we had
lost the greater part of our lead. I was no exception. When I was faced by a
decision: to attempt to seize the initiative by an exchange sacrifice, or to
play quietly, I chose the second path, and soon offered a draw. Najdorf said
that he would consider it, then twice during his 45 minutes' thought consulted
with the captain of the Rest of the World team, Dr Euwe, and finally stretched
out his hand to me, adding: 'But the position is completely won for White!'
The 'dessert' after the 'Match of the Century' was the unofficial World
Lightning Championship. Interest was intensified by the fact that, for
apparently the first time, Fischer was taking part in an international
lightning tournament. Prior to this, Soviet players had often played
five-minute games with him, and on the basis of this previous experience he
was not considered one of the main contenders for first place. --- In the
first round, by tradition, I lost to him from a superior ending, and in the
second was technically punished by Robert for attempting to win one back. He
played excellently throughout the tournament, and ended up the winner, but I
played unevenly, losing several strange games. My wins against Reshevsky and
Korchnoi are worth mentioning.} 17. g4 dxe5 18. fxe5 Nxe5 19. Nxe5 Rxe5 20. Bd4

{Then I appeared for the Soviet team in the European Team Championship at
Kapfenberg. Clearly, if the USSR team had been able to defeat the Rest of the
World in the 'Match of the Century', on the same 10 boards the best teams of
Europe were beaten without much difficulty. One of my games, against Kolarov,
has found its way into this book. --- After this I took part in a completely
new, unusual event. In Dnepropetrovsk, the USSR Cup Competition was held on
the so-called Olympic system, in which the losers drop out. In chess this is
not normal, and in addition, the time limit used was unusual: 45 moves in 2
hours 15 minutes, then 20 moves in the next hour, and a further hour for the
remainder of the game. If the main match of four games ended in a draw, then
two more games were to be played at semi-blitz speed, 1 hour for the whole
game, and if the score was still level, so on at this rate until the first win.
--- The seven Grandmasters competing were exempted from the first round, and
went straight into the last 32. I played three matches, and I cannot say that
the draw was very kind to me. Each encounter was with a 'known' player,
although there were a number of less experienced masters, unfamiliar to me,
taking part at Dnepropetrovsk. One of the games from my first match, with the
very solid International Master Bagirov, is given here. Our match finished
ahead of schedule since after a draw in the first game I won the next two. The
fate of each of my next two matches was decided in the last game. First I
played against Grandmaster Gufeld. Over a long period he had only won once
against me, and in the majority of the other games had been unsuccessful,
although he had sometimes had good positions. This was repeated in the match,
and Gufeld reacted so strongly to this that he even appeared in print with
notes to three of the games. --- In the first game, I adjourned a pawn down in
a difficult position, but on resumption succeeded in complicating my
opponent's task, and we reached a queen ending, in which, as is well known,
one can give as many checks as one likes. After the second time control, in a
now equal position, Gufeld marked off on his scoresheet a further twenty moves,
and was most surprised when I reminded him that there would be no further
control, and that we had to play on until the fall of the first flag. He had
some ten minutes remaining, while I had about twice as much, but I refrained
from exploiting such an 'advantage'. --- The next two games were drawn, and
then in the fourth, my opponent's nerves did not hold out.} 19. Bxc5 $1 gxf5 $1

the better chances in the 'quick' games, but suddenly it seemed to me that my
opponent had played the opening too loosely as Black, and I decided to
'punish' him, and sacrificed a pawn. This led to a slightly better ending for
Black, in which Savon began to 'torment' me. I was unable to stand this
'torture', and so I did not go forward into the semi-final. --- The winner of
the Cup was the initiator of the event in this form, Grandmaster Bronstein.
--- Whether it was because I did not perform too well in this event or for
some other reason, I don't know, but after the USSR Cup I was forgotten, and
remembered only when the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
decided to hold a very interesting Match-Tournament in Sochi, between seven
Grandmasters and seven very strong young masters. In the Grandmaster team
there were such highly-qualified examiners as Korchnoi and Stein, while the
majority of our young opponents have since become Grandmasters themselves. ---
Even so, the tournament did not have an official status, and perhaps it was
because of this that, after our game, Tukmakov said that in Sochi the 'old
Tal' was playing. Two games from this tournament are given here. --- I awaited
the USSR Championship in my home town of Riga with great impatience, but for
formal reasons I was not allowed in. Much as it pained me, I had to make do
with the role of correspondent.} 1/2-1/2

As you can see, in the final position I am the exchange and a pawn down, but
it is my opponent who has to force the draw. The question of first place
remained open until the penultimate round. I lost recklessly to the master
Kyarner, while Stein defeated Keres in an important encounter, and finished
first, ahead of Keres and myself by half a point. --- Individual tournaments
always alternate with team events, and I was still 'fit' to play for the
'Daugava' team. Off we went to Rostov-on-Don, to the Championship of the
Country. At this time our team was experiencing a crisis, since many strong
players from Latvia had joined the Army Sports Club and accompanied us with
the certainty that we would finish in one of the bottom places and drop out of
the Premier League. But we were a happy group, and once again an old truth was
confirmed: in team events, a high Elo coefficient is only half (and the less
important half!) of a guarantee of success. --- I played pretty well, and
received the prize for the best result on board one, but some really severe
tests awaited me at the end of the year: first the USSR Championship in
Leningrad, and then the International Alekhine Memorial Tournament in Moscow.}
(42... -- {In Leningrad I could not rid myself of a strange sensation.
Everything was apparently going alright: at first three draws and then four
wins in a row, but somewhere inside me there was this feeling: 'There's
something missing'. Indeed, as White I then lost without a fight to
Sharnkovich - this was one of the most undistinguished games of my whole life.
--- Then fatigue gradually began to take over. After all, when thoughts do not
arise with their normal ease and confidence, one has to compensate for this by
'squeezing out' the points. In the second half of the Championship, I
adjourned almost every game, and on the days set aside for adjournments I had
to sit down at the board three times. --- I was a contender for first place
almost to the very end, but a defeat at the hands of Stein deprived me of my
chance of taking the title, while an amazing defence by the master K.
Grigorian, who received the prize for the best ending, allowed Smyslov to draw
level with me before the last round. By drawing this final game with each
other, we received silver medals, while the 'gold' and the title of
Grandmaster went to Savon. --- In this tournament I played for the first time
against Anatoly Karpov. On this occasion no real fight developed, but we more
than made up for this with a very tense struggle a month later in the Alekhine
Memorial. --- Eighteen Grandmasters took part in that event (only Balashov was
awaiting confirmation of his title). My play was highly uneven. It began in my
now traditional first round, when I gave the spectators a few happy moments by
declining a draw against Olafsson, and then, in far from Grandmaster style,
overlooking a standard mate in two moves on the back rank. --- Subsequently
there were further adventures, and some quite good games (one of them, against
Uhlmann, which received the prize for the most brilliant attack, is given in
the book; incidentally, it was here that Uhlmann established his record,
thinking over the move 12...exf5 for 1 hour 50 minutes), but I should like to
single out the game with Karpov. This young player had already twice performed
quite well in the Championship of our Country, finishing up each time around
5th place, but the veterans, among whom I include myself, did not rate his
chances very highly. On sitting down against him, I considered myself almost
obliged to win. --- A few inaccuracies, and Karpov found himself in
difficulties; then he overlooked a small tactical finesse, and came out a pawn
down with an inferior position.}) (42... -- {At this point, having confirmed
for myself my sceptical assessment of Karpov's play, I considered the fate of
the game to be decided. --- But I only had to play not very accurately for
Anatoly to obtain immediate counterplay. The position became sharper, and then
an ending was reached in which I had two rooks against a queen. I recalled a
similar ending from my match with Korchnoi and decided that history would not
repeat itself, and that I would play cautiously and accurately, and head for
the adjournment. --- For some reason or other, I did not manage to analyse the
position thoroughly, and we decided that I should make a sufficient number of
moves to reach the second adjournment, since Karpov, in our opinion, could not
strengthen his position. --- Evidently Karpov also realised that his position
was objectively lost, and straight after the resumption he made a bold raid
with his king. It had to be refuted tactically, but for this I was unprepared.
When we adjourned the game for the second time the position was already drawn.
My final result in the tournament, a share of 6th-7th places with the then
World Champion Spassky, could hardly be considered a success for either of us.
--- The first quarter of 1972 was devoted to preparing the Latvian team for
the first ever All-Union Chess Olympiad, and competing in the Olympiad itself.
Included in these preparations was a friendly match for which we travelled to
Leningrad. --- Both of my games against Korchnoi ended in draws. Then we
played in Vilnius in the traditional tournament for the Baltic Capitals with
the inclusion of Minsk. Of the three games here, I drew two, lost the third to
the master Kapengut, and then we set off to Moscow for the Olympiad. --- Once
again we took part in the traditional semi-finals, and once again the draw
brought us up against the Byelorussian team - our regular opponents against
whom we are usually lucky.}) (42... -- {JOURNALIST. Just a moment! The class
of your play is significantly higher than that of your fellow team members.
What are your duties associated with this? --- CHESS PLAYER. The main one,
strange as it may seem, is not the individual 'extracting' of points: these
are equally valuable on the first board and on the tenth. The main duty is a
consultation with each player before each round (true, this does not apply to
Gipslis and Klovans when we appear for the Latvian team, and not 'Daugava'),
and, of course, the analysis of adjourned positions, difficult though it may
be to straight away produce a 'diagnosis' on each of 5-6 adjournments in the
same round. To return to the Olympiad, up to the last round of the semi-final
it was not clear who would go forward to the main final: our team, or the
Byelorussians. (The formidable Moscow team was already safely assured of one
place.) In the penultimate round we heavily defeated Byelorussia, and in the
last round - Kazakhstan (my game from this match with the master M. Mukhin is
given here), and we went forward into the final. --- There we finished in 'our
own' sixth place. I would have taken first place on board one if I had simply
not played in the last round, and instead had given up my place to a reserve.
However, our last round opponents were the Leningrad team, and I could not
avoid playing against Korchnoi: our chess 'relationship' was too well known to
everyone. So I played, the game ended in a draw, and the prize for the best
result amongst the leaders went to Keres. This especially pleased me, since he
was a founder of the Riga magazine Shakhmaty. --- After the Olympiad came
another interval of four months, and how difficult it is to keep in good form
without the necessary practice... --- This chess 'Lent' was broken by a small
tournament in Viljandi, one of those organised with such skill and love by
Estonian chess players. In this little resort there assembled three
Grandmasters, several masters, and the strongest Estonian players. It was here
- although of course I found this out only later - that I suffered my last
defeat in 1972. The tournament developed into a race between myself and the
Moscow master Dvoretsky, but when I lost to the master Uusi (the game was
adjourned in a drawn position, but on the way to the tournament hall I
suddenly ceased to want a draw, and on the second move I allowed my opponent
to force mate), Sharnkovich and Suetin immediately drew level with me. Really
enraged by such a stupid loss I defeated both of them, then scored my third
point in succession in the last round, but nevertheless finished half a point
behind Dvoretsky. --- And then - though I naturally had no suspicion of it at
the time - there began that long series of games without defeat, of which, to
my sincere amazement, so much was written in the press. --- Up till the last
minute, the composition of our Olympiad team was not fixed, and in the end,
when those who had definitely been included were making preparations, Savon
and I set off to an International Tournament in Sukhumi. This was considered
to be a final testing for us, and for this I personally was glad: I have
always preferred live participation in a tournament to theoretical preparation.
--- And so - Sukhumi. It was hot, with the temperature in the shade sometimes
reaching 35~/=C, and the Northerners amongst us suffered pretty badly from it.
Thus, for instance, Robert Hübner, with whom I became acquainted in Sukhumi,
got sunburnt and his skin began to peel.}) 1/2-1/2

{I began the tournament moderately, although I realised that it was bound to
develop into a race with Savon. As it turned out, my game with him was the
critical one. In the opening I fell into a variation prepared by Army players,
got into a difficult position, and only succeeded in gaining some sort of play
just before the time control. Even so, I had no real illusions about the
adjourned position, which is just what Savon thought, and evidently it was
this that allowed me to slip out. --- In the course of the resumption the
following episode occurred. We were playing with a clock of far from perfect
construction, and on which the flag fell at nowhere near the correct time. It
fell on Savon's clock just as he was making his last move before the time
control. I saw that by rights White had at least a minute left, and to demand
a loss on time in such circumstances seemed blasphemous to me. All these
thoughts occurred in a flash, and before the controller had time to record the
fall of the flag, I made a move and pressed my clock. The game subsequently
ended in a draw. Towards the end I managed to win almost every game, and thus
take first place, while for the following game I was awarded a special prize.}

{JOURNALIST. How do you react to injustices committed against you? --- CHESS
PLAYER. I don't care for them at all, to put it mildly. On a previous occasion
I became extremely nervy when, once again at the last minute, I was excluded
from the team for the Lugano Olympiad, but usually I grit my teeth and try to
laugh, though, it is true, the laugh comes out rather malevolently. --- Savon,
a very sensitive person, was so affected by the nervous strain, that in Skopje
the Soviet team was essentially a man short. --- We got through the
preliminary group calmly enough, if you don't take into account the tense
match with Cuba, which the Soviet team won only because the controller did not
record Korchnoi's loss on time against Garcia, while the Cuban (and perhaps
Korchnoi as well) did not notice it. In the final, our troubles started in the
very first round. In the match with our traditionally difficult opponents, the
Hungarian team, our top four players scored three draws and one loss (Bilek
won against Korchnoi). In the next three matches we won with great difficulty
by the minimum margin, but in each of them one of the Soviet players was
defeated. --- There had been Olympiads where the Soviet team had gone through
without losing a single game! (or, at most, one or two). But here Petrosian
lost in the match against West Germany, Savon against Holland, and Karpov
against Bulgaria. --- I had managed to win all my games, but it is the
resumption with Radulov that I recall. At that point we were by no means
winning the match (one draw, three adjournments), and were more concerned with
ensuring that we didn't lose. We split up into groups for analysis and my
consultant was Grandmaster Keres, our team's trainer. I have quite a large
number of chess memories, but that night of analysis with Keres is one of the
most pleasant. The work was calm, flowing, as it were, of its own accord;
every hour a cup of coffee was consumed... and I never even suspected that
such an apparently uninteresting ending (I was a pawn up, with rooks and
opposite-coloured bishops) could contain so many interesting and beautiful
ideas. Incidentally, the analysis proved to be highly productive, for when on
the following day the game was again adjourned, on the 72nd move, Keres and I
were perfectly familiar with the position: we had reached it in our analysis
the previous night. There was no need for a second resumption: Radulov
resigned without further play. --- Since the Bulgarian Grandmaster Tringov
forgot(!!) to put his scoresheet with the sealed move inside the envelope,
Korchnoi was awarded the point, and we won the match. --- Since the team saw
that I was playing well, I was also included for the next match.} 22... Nde5 $1

Gradually we began to steal up on the leading group, and after a victory over
Yugoslavia by 2½-1½, our chances of the gold medal became fairly serious.
But then unexpected setbacks in the matches with Czechoslovakia and Argentina 
(all eight games were drawn!) once again undermined our position. --- At the
same time, the young and ambitious Hungarian team, 'scenting' success, was
playing with great enthusiasm, and was close to a heavy win against the Dutch,
whereupon a sensation was possible: the permanent champions - the USSR team -
might not be able to catch their friends and rivals. --- But suddenly the hall
groaned; the Hungarian Forintos had blundered into a mate, and the chances of
the two leading teams became level. --- Prior to the last round, we were only
slightly ahead of the Hungarians, splendidly led by Portisch. We met for the
final discussion regarding the composition of our team. The leaders of our
Chess Federation phoned from Moscow, and advised, even demanded, that both Tal
and Karpov should definitely play. Unfortunately, we were playing on adjacent
boards - myself on board four, and Karpov as first reserve - and there was no
way in which we could both have the white pieces (which is what they were
hoping for). As a result I was given the black pieces in the final match with
Rumania. --- On arriving for the match, we looked at the teams in the equally
important match between Hungary and West Germany, and received a rude shock:
the Germans were appearing without their leader, Grandmaster Hubner, who had
won the prize for the best score on board one, and their number two,
Grandmaster Darga. Straight away we began to be nagged by doubts: 'Can it be
that the Germans are trying, after all, to organise a sensation?'. --- Only at
the closing of the Olympiad did we find out that Hubner did not want to risk
his assured first place on board one, while Darga did not play, so as to give
International Master Pfleger the chance to play against Portisch, and in the
event of success (as Black!), to become a Grandmaster. --- All this we found
out later, but during the match we saw that the German masters were playing
very conscientiously. The young Hungarians, on the other hand, were evidently
'burned out' before this decisive encounter, and the result was 2-2. --- Our
match was not as tense as might have been expected. Karpov and Korchnoi,
playing White, quickly obtained winning positions, while Petrosian and I drew
as Black. --- This is how our difficult victory at the Olympiad in Skopje was
achieved. On my board I took first place with a score of 12 wins and 4 draws.
After this I had to make a choice: whether to play in the USSR Zonal
Championship. I already had the right to play in the Interzonal Tournament,
but after the story of 1970 I felt obliged not to miss any Championship of the
Country in which I had the chance to play. Thus I set off for Baku, where I
was the lone 'Interzonaller', and so was hors concours as regards the three
places into the Interzonal. --- I started off extremely sluggishly with six
draws in a row and more than once my technique of realising an advantage
misfired embarrassingly. At one point I had so lost confidence in myself, that
the thought even entered my head: am I capable of winning even one game?
Perhaps it was with the object of psychotherapy that I sat down in the foyer
of the tournament hall to play lightning chess with local first category
players. Here I was successful, my peace of mind was restored, and this told
immediately on my results.} 0-1

{The Championship ended, and the 'Russian troika' of Grandmasters - Balashov,
Vasiukov and Tal - as the Dutch described us, arrived for the traditional
tournament at Wijk aan Zee. --- I once again began modestly. True, in the
first round I played and made the acquaintance of the young Yugoslav Albin
Planinc, as well as his colleague Ljubomir Ljubojevic, about whom I had heard
many good things, and many sceptical ones. I found out for myself the
unevenness of Planinc's play. To me he lost without much of a fight, but then
he crushed Donner and Najdorf in turn, literally within 20 moves. ---
Meanwhile, I had reduced my pace, but since the results among the leading
group were very even, some four rounds before the finish there were still
eight or nine contestants within an interval of one point. --- I was pinning
my hopes on the finish, but in the 12th round I noticed that my opponent, Hort,
had a shocking cold, and I decided not to torment him for long. I won my last
three games, the first as follows:} 14. c5 Qxd4 15. Re4 Bxf3 16. gxf3 Nh3+ 17.

Before the start of the last round, Balashov was level with me, and the
newspapers were already saying that the two Russians would draw, and thereby
assure themselves of a share of first place. However, we both played for a win,
and I alone was successful.} 1-0

{On the way home we stayed on for a short time in Holland, appearing before
chess fans, and then a few days after my return there began a tournament which
I consider to be one of my best during the last few years. It was the
traditional Tallinn Tournament, the third in number. --- Its popularity had
grown, and on this occasion the list of Soviet players was even more
impressive. For the first time Spassky and Polugaevsky were playing, as well
as Keres, Bronstein, Tal, and other well-known players. From my initial wins I
can pick out two examples of squeezes in more or less positional style.} 14...

{JOURNALIST. This was the fifth successive tournament that you had gone

more 'old'. Of course, giving mate to the enemy king had ceased to be an end
in itself. But even at that time I did not play with the draw in hand, and, to
be honest, the thing that least worried me was this unbeaten run. Besides, I

{The Interzonal Tournament was approaching, but prior to it I took part in two
somewhat unusual events. --- The first, organised by the Central Committee of
the Communist Youth League, was a tournament of Pioneers' Palaces. I had last
played for my Palace in Riga exactly 15 years previously, and here I was, once
again amongst the lads. Each team was led by a former pupil, now Grandmaster:
Smyslov, Spassky, Petrosian, Karpov, Bronstein, myself... we gave
simultaneous displays with clocks against the lads from the other teams, and
then added together the points gained by each captain and his team. At the
same time there was a separate event for the team captains. --- Each morning I
would meet my lads, and talk to them about the day's 'examiner', and I
breathed for myself the air of chess youth. It was all splendid! --- In the
captain's competition I came first, and here is one of the games, against the
young Candidate Master Zaid.} 19. Bxf7+ $1 Kxf7 20. Qd5+ Kg6 ({If} 20... Kf8 {

before the last 'intermediate' event, the Match-Tournament between the three
USSR teams, and I went into hospital for a minor operation. --- It was not at
all essential, and the doctors, as far as I understood, performed it 'just in
case'. It was all but four years since I had been in hospital. I had grown
unaccustomed to this 'pleasure', and the acclimatisation was not altogether
successful. When, straight after the operation, I arrived for the team match,
my unbeaten run came to an abrupt end. After first defeating Bronstein, I then
lost twice to Balashov. In these games he played better than I did, but I paid
little attention to this warning. After all, I had never made much of this
famous run, and when it came to an end I said jokingly: 'Fine! Now I can start
a new one ...' --- But the new run began, unfortunately, somewhat later, after
the Interzonal Tournament. It is difficult to decide exactly why it happened,
but at the start of the Interzonal I played extremely badly. I can reproach
myself only for the fact that I did not realise it immediately, although the
very first game should have warned me. I was satisfied with the result, a draw
as Black against Smejkal, but in the course of the game I missed a spectacular
but by no means difficult combination, which would have given me somewhat the
better chances. --- Then came two defeats at the hands of players who could by
no means be considered amongst the strongest: Torre and Estevez. I played
unevenly and got into time-trouble, where my poor form immediately showed
itself. Blunders followed one after another, and among the things I overlooked
was a mate! --- This poor start evidently affected my delicate kidney, and I
fell ill. After missing two rounds I resumed play, and went into the game
against Korchnoi with just one desire: to win. He guessed my state of mind,
and around move ten offered a draw. I impulsively declined, and then began
seeking an objective reason for doing so. I began a sort of clearly
'left-sided' plan, got into an inferior position, and after mistakes by both
sides in the time-scramble, adjourned the game in a difficult position.} (35.
-- {Next I lost to Hubner in a game where I stood better at one point, but
then adjourned several games with winning chances, and did not as yet lose my
optimism. --- I was nevertheless playing 'creakily', with difficulty, and this
led to my amassing 6(!!) adjourned games: a difficult position against
Korchnoi, and better positions, as I thought, against Kuzmin, Karpov and
Tukmakov, as well as against Quinteros and Cuellar. If they were all to end up
as I was planning, then all would not yet be lost in the tournament. But the
resumption brought a serious correction, since it was impossible to analyse
all the positions anything like thoroughly. We managed this only in the game
against Tukmakov, finding a win at around three in the morning, and merely
made a superficial acquaintance with the others. --- The resumption began with
the game against Korchnoi, where a loss was more or less planned. Then came
Kuzmin, and I suddenly saw that in my nocturnal analysis (at about 5 a.m.) I
had made two moves in a row for myself(!!) which, of course, one could not
count on doing in an official situation. I should have agreed a draw, but I
thought for about forty minutes, and then, just at the point when I was ready
to conclude peace, Kotov, the chief controller came up and informed me that
Tukmakov had resigned without playing on. The thought flashed through my mind
that if I were to draw with Kuzmin now, I would then have to play on against
Karpov, and my adjournment analysis had not gone as far as that position. ---
So I decided to continue, and played on... to a hopeless position. ---
Following this, my results had no significance for me. Even a successful
second half of the tournament, with 6½ out of 9, the games played against
Larsen and Gligoric during this time are given here) only enabled me to finish
high enough to take the last prize. --- Strange as it may seem, I was grieved
by the fact that my best game, which was awarded a special prize, should have
been against Larsen, with whom I sympathised, and who I very much wanted to
see amongst the winners.}) 1-0

1. c4 {A little bit of sharp practice. In the previous game between us with
the same colours, the Caro-Kann Defence occurred. --- This time also White has
nothing against repeating the Panov Attack, but with his first move rules out
the possibility of Bagirov playing the Alekhine Defence, on the theory of
which the Baku player works a great deal. --- Besides the Caro-Kann, the Slav
Defence is also in the Baku master's opening repertoire, so his reply was easy
to foresee.} c6 2. e4 {After the match Bagirov admitted that my second move
had been a surprise to him, since he had not planned to play the Caro-Kann
Defence (by transposition of moves the Panov Attack is reached).} d5 3. exd5

Nxd4 {. After lengthy reflection Polugaevsky rejected the tempting and very
strong move} 8. Nf3 {, but now this move could be expected, if only because
after the game all the participants in the championship found out about it.})
6. Nf3 Be7 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. O-O Nc6 10. a3 {The move in the game is
in no way stronger than the approved 10 Re1 but it does have one advantage,
that of novelty. Bagirov proves to be less prepared for it.} ({This same
position occurred between us in the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad in 1967. On that
occasion I played} 10. Re1 {, and after} Bf6 11. Be4 Nce7 {Black obtained a
reasonable position, although all through the game he had to overcome certain
difficulties.}) 10... Nxc3 {This is certainly playable.} ({Also possible is} 
10... Nf6 {, transposing into a line of the Queen's Gambit.}) 11. bxc3 Bf6 12.
Qe2 {On this move I spent a considerable time as it was essential to decide
what plan to adopt. In place of the isolated d-pawn, an isolated pawn couple
has appeared. One of the possible plans here is the advance of the central
pawns. This can be done as follows: Bb2, Qe2, rooks on d1 and possibly c1, the
bishop moves away from d3, and then, if feasible, c4 and d5. However, Black
also has time to develop his forces:... b6, ...Bb7, ...Na5, controlling the
d5-square, and possibly organising counterplay along the c-file. Therefore
White makes the noncommittal move 12 Qe2 which is useful for the harmonious
development of the heavy artillery, and also for active operations on the
kingside.} ({In passing, White sets a little trap: if Black tries to free
himself by} 12. Qe2 e5 {White is not limited to the win of a pawn by} 13. dxe5
Nxe5 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 15. Bxh7+ ({but can play the stronger} 15. Qe4 g6 16. Qxe5

} 12... b6 {fails to} 13. Qe4 {.}) ({However, the quiet} 12... g6 {was worth
considering.}) 13. Rb1 b6 {The fact that this advance of the b-pawn has been
provoked must be considered useful for White, since he insures himself against
a possible counter-attack by Black involving the move ...Qa5 (the c3-pawn is
attacked, and in some cases the queen can be transferred to the kingside).} 14.
Re1 ({In this position White thought for some time over the consequences of} 
14. h4 {. But what I didn't like was} Ne7 {(capturing on h4 naturally fails to
15 Qe4) with the possible variation} 15. Ng5 Nf5 $1 {. Now} 16. g4 {is too
dangerous in view of} Nxh4 17. Nxh7 Bc6 {when it is Black who has a very
strong attack.}) ({After the text-move, it is by no means easy for Black to
solve the problem of how to develop his pieces. On} 14. Re1 Ne7 {,} 15. Ne5 {
, transposing into positional lines, is possible (Bd2, Rbd1 etc.).}) 14... Re8

capture the pawn:} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 Bxe5 17. Bxh7+ ({not} 17. Qxe5 Re8)

position, since the heavy pieces are still present, while the black king's
shelter leaves much to be desired. Bagirov wishes to carry out the freeing
pawn advance under more favourable circumstances, but now some rather amusing
complications arise almost by force.}) 15. h4 {Once again, of course,
capturing the h-pawn is out of the question because of 16 Qe4. White plans to
continue Ng5 with an attack. Here 15...Ne7 appears less attractive because of
16 Ne5, and the weakening of f7 tells: the thematic combination Bxh7+ etc is
threatened. --- However, the move 15 h4 appears to be very double-edged, and
therefore Black's traditional decision - to answer a flank diversion with a
counterblow in the centre - is perfectly natural.} e5 {This was the
continuation to which White devoted most attention. Now he has to act very
energetically, otherwise Black will seize the initiative and his
counter-attack can develop very quickly.} 16. Ng5 exd4 {Consistent and quite
good, although to a certain extent forced.} ({In answer to} 16... h6 {,} 17.

a number of active possibilities. However, White's threats on the kingside

continue to play aggressively.} ({On} 20. Bf4 {,} Bf5 {, forcing favourable

essential.} ({After} 20... fxg5 {White could reply} 21. hxg5 {with many
threats.}) 21. Rxe4 Kg8 {What a pity! After this feeble king move Black is
simply the exchange down without any compensation. The remaining part of the
game is reduced to the purely technical realisation of the material advantage

that in the previous Championship of the country it was Shamkovich who
inflicted on the tournament leader Tal his first defeat in the 8th round was,
perhaps, one of the inspiring stimuli for the Riga player before the start of
the game given below. For 'invigoration' this game was once again played
through before the start of the 16th round here in Baku. There were some very
clear analogies. In both cases Shamkovich had Black. Prior to this game Tal
was again undefeated. Also, arithmetically the number 16 in some way resembles

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. b3 {The Finnish master adopts this move fairly often;
indeed, two years ago here in Tallinn, he defeated L. Stein in this variation.
Looking through some chess magazines literally half an hour before the start
of the game, I came across the game Westerinen-Kaplan, Skopje 1972, which
White had lost in 20 moves, and without checking any further I decided to
follow the Puerto-Rican.} Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bb2 Be7 6. c4 Nc7 ({Of course, the
normal continuation is} 6... Nb4 {, but after all, Kaplan had won quickly...})
7. Nc3 f6 8. Ne4 fxe5 9. Nxe5 O-O {At Skopje in this position Westerinen
continued 10 Qg4?, and after 10...Ne8 Black quickly seized the initiative, as
within two moves (11...d6 and 12...e5) the activity of the bishop on b2 was
curtailed. Of course, it was extremely naive to expect that the Finnish master
would repeat the game to the end.} 10. d4 {It turns out that White has a
certain advantage on his side.} cxd4 ({On} 10... d6 {there could follow} 11.
Nf3 cxd4 12. Qxd4 e5 13. Qe3 {, and his pressure along the d-file gives White
excellent prospects.}) 11. Qxd4 Bb4+ 12. Kd1 ({Westerinen is a player with a
very active style, and he is not satisfied by the continuation} 12. Bc3 Nc6 13.
Nxc6 Bxc3+ 14. Qxc3 bxc6 {, which only gives him a slight positional advantage.
White's desire to keep his bishop also has a positional basis, but
Westerinen's technical solution of the problem is inaccurate.}) ({Much more
dangerous for Black was} 12. Ke2 {. The difference becomes noticeable
immediately.}) 12... d6 $1 {It is surprising, but apparently this simple move
escaped Westerinen 's attention.} 13. Nd3 ({It turns out that after} 13. Nc6 e5
{White loses a piece. If White's king was on e2, then possible would be 13 a3
dxe5 (there is no other move) 14 Qd8 Rxd8 15 axb4 Nc6, with an unclear ending.
Incidentally, in this variation 14 Qxe5 is also worth considering.}) 13... e5
14. Qe3 Ba5 $1 {Yet another distinction. In this variation also, White's king
would be better placed on e2, since he would then have the move Rd1.} ({The
position of the king on the d-file caused Black to consider the immediate} 
14... d5 {, but I decided that after} 15. Nxb4 dxe4+ 16. Kc2 {White would
succeed in completing his development. The modest move in the game is
considerably more unpleasant as now the threat of the advance of the central
pawn must be taken seriously.}) 15. Qg5 Qd7 $1 {Of course, the exchange of
queens would also have given Black a certain advantage, but the queen is not
badly placed on d7.} 16. Kc2 Qc6 $1 ({Black spent quite a considerable time
examining the immediate} 16... b5 {and sharp variations such as} 17. Rd1 bxc4
18. Nxe5 Qf5 19. Bxc4+ d5 20. Rxd5 {etc, but then I noticed the apparently
awkward queen move, which, as becomes clear, leads to a big, and perhaps
decisive, advantage. Black straight away develops his pieces with gain of time,

losses only by 20 Kd1 but I think that the resulting position does not require
assessment.}) 20... Nb5 21. Kb2 Nxa3 22. Qe3 ({After} 22. Kxa3 {Black wins
immediately by} Bxd3 23. Bxd3 Qc5+ 24. Kb2 Qd4+ {.}) 22... Nb4 ({This is

1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. Nf3 c5 {Since White, by avoiding the advance of his
d-pawn, has not insisted on the King's Indian Defence, the game now goes into
one of the popular systems of the English Opening. The theoretical opinion,
that Black obtains a comfortable position, has been confirmed on numerous
occasions. The one drawback to the system was disclosed by Taimanov in my game
with him a few rounds earlier. If White wants to draw, then he can. But
against a player like Larsen, one doesn't have to worry about such 'aggressive
peacefulness'.} 4. g3 Nc6 5. Bg2 e6 6. O-O Nge7 7. d3 {The supposition is
proved correct; the Danish grandmaster avoids a symmetrical pawn set-up in the
centre.} O-O 8. Bd2 d5 9. Qc1 {As the Petrosian-Fischer game from the 'Match
of the Century' showed, immediate operations on the queenside similarly do not

{A little later, during the Premier League of the USSR Championship, I was
reproached for the fact that fatigue after the tournament in Sochi was telling
on my play. This is hardly justified. Of course, the consequence of my failure
in the Interzonal was still having its effect, but even so I played better in
the Championship in Moscow than I had in Sochi. It was more likely that I was
affected by the cold that I caught at the very start of the event, which led
to my games from the second and third rounds being postponed. By the way, for
my relatively quick recovery, I am completely indebted to my wife, who was
partially filling the role of my second. --- Let us return to the Championship.
I recall my game with Polugaevsky, which was an exact reflection of the fourth
game of my match with Larsen. After correctly sacrificing a pawn, I thought
for 50 minutes over a tempting piece sacrifice, each minute becoming more and
more convinced that it would not work. When everything was quite clear, I
suddenly became angry with myself for wasting such a lot of time and...
sacrificed! With a few moves, which I had foreseen quite clearly, Polugaevsky
repulsed the attack, and it was all over. --- My subsequent play was rather

{Before the new year began I first played six games in a Match-Tournament
between the Russian Federation and Latvian teams, and then accepted with
pleasure an invitation to play in an International Tournament in Dubna, a
small town near Moscow, and a scientific centre of world renown. The audience
there, consisting of physicists from various countries, was very congenial, as
was the composition of the tournament. --- I was late for the first round, and
I entered the hall just as Kholmov was giving mate to Rukavina. It was at the
start when I succeeded in playing my most interesting games (of course, I

chance to catch me.} (12. -- {JOURNALIST. Incidentally, what general qualities
should a second have? --- CHESS PLAYER. In the first place, he should be
faithful to his protégé. He must know his protégé well, be able to tell his
condition 'from the side', and be able to suggest when is the right time to
play more reservedly, and when to give full rein to instinct. The second may
be a like-minded chess thinker, or a chess antipode, it is not of great
importance. On the other hand, it is most essential that he should not be
overawed by the prestige of his protégé. Of course, it is important that the
second should carefully follow current chess literature, since there is no
point in having to invent everything anew in the process of preparation. With
regard to whether or not the second is a theorist, this is not all that
important. --- I very much dislike 'seasonal' seconds: today he assists
grandmaster A, tomorrow grandmaster B against grandmaster A, etc. This is
unpleasant, and, I would say, not altogether honest. --- It was not without
certain adventures that Kuzmin and I reached Hastings, since we were forced by
the weather to wait for more than 24 hours at Moscow airport. We eventually
arrived only a few hours before the start of a round, not the first, but the
second! --- After such a flight we were unable to play at full strength, and
both our games were pretty quickly agreed drawn. In general, my play in
Hastings was affected by a depression which set in after my game with the
Cuban master G. Garcia. --- In this game the slight threat of an attack on my
opponent's king persuaded him to give up the exchange, just so as to go into
an ending. After a further few moves his position became hopeless, and I
thought to myself: 'How good that it has all worked out so quickly; I may be
in time to go to the cinema'. Especially since, due to our late arrival,
Kuzmin and I had to play eight games on successive days, and we were glad of
every rest hour we could find. --- Then suddenly, having relaxed, I made a bad
blunder, and the game continued for the full five hours, and ended in a draw.
--- This affected my play, as did another unexpected consequence of our late
arrival. --- When we arrived, all the decent rooms in the hotel had been taken,
and we were accommodated somewhere in the attic in a completely unheated room.
Both of us - first I, then Kuzmin - caught a cold and fell ill. Even my wife
could tell this from my voice when she phoned me on New Year's Eve. I told her
that it was cold in our room, and the reaction was unexpected. Without saying
a word about it to me she phoned Moscow and asked our Chess Federation to help
me, to which the head of the Federation jokingly advised her to send to
Hastings some firewood or coal. --- Whatever the cause, my depression or the
'energy crisis', in the first eight rounds I scored only one win and seven
draws, and was going steadily along in 7th-8th place. Then, by winning three
games in a row, I joined the leading group, and when Kuzmin, having caught
cold in turn, lost two games, the battle for first place intensified. --- Of
the games from this spurt, the ones against Stean and Hartston turned out
quite well, but it was the following ending that afforded me the most pleasure
(see the following game).}) 1-0

for first place. Kuzmin and Szabo quickly agreed a draw, Timman defeated
Suttles, reached the Grandmaster norm and caught up with them, while after the
adjournment I also agreed a draw with the young Englishman Miles, and thus
became one of the four joint winners. --- I do not want to return to this
theme once again, but I spent the first half of 1974 in 'hibernation'; I
played only two games in a friendly match between the Sports Societies
'Daugava' and 'Avantgarde' - I think you will agree that this is too meagre a
ration for a player who very much loves playing. True, in one of these games I
tried out an idea which was to bring me three points in 1974. --- By contrast,
the remainder of the year was not just crowded, but overloaded with events.
--- In May there came preparations for the Olympiad in Nice, and once again we
had seven grandmasters contending for the six places in the team. On this
occasion my inclusion was not in doubt, and the 'superfluous seventh' turned
out to be Lev Polugaevsky, a recent Candidate. --- In Nice, Kuzmin, who had
also been mainly inactive from January to June, and I played in most of the
games in the preliminary group, in order to 'warm up'. This was very necessary,
since in my first few games I made some very amusing mistakes, which in one
case led to a draw with an opponent whose class of play was not all that high.
--- I felt that I was running into form only after the game given here with
Miagmasuren. After I had sacrificed a rook the spectators gathered round, and
this was immediately noticed by the leader of our delegation, V. D. Baturinsky,
who had just come into the hall. Being short in stature, he was unable to see
over the heads of the others, but when I stood up from the table, I
confidentially informed him that I was a rook down. --- 'Blundered?' our chief
asked indignantly, clearly ready to remind me of the instructions given before
the game to play quietly and carefully. --- 'Sacrificed!' --- 'Well, only mind
you play carefully' (!) Baturinsky recapitulated somewhat perplexedly.} 0-1

there not unexpectedly followed an 'epilogue'. --- My game with Adamski
developed in very tense fashion. My opponent very much wanted to draw, and
even asked me before the game not to 'torment' him, if we should reach an
equal ending. However, when he offered a draw after I had been thinking
seriously for 30 minutes, I was irritated, instantly declined it, and straight
away... left a pawn en prise. We concluded the game in a terrible
time-scramble, in which my opponent gave up recording the game round about
move 25, and I some five moves later. --- In the course of this rapid play I
could have forced a draw, but I overlooked this, and instead left a piece en
prise. Adamski made his move, and I saw that it was time to resign. All the
same I made one more move, and my opponent's flag fell, but there was a
controller standing by, and he said nothing, so I assumed that the 40 moves
must have been made. Holding out my hand in a sign of resignation, I suddenly
heard the voice of my wife, speaking in Latvian: 'Have you made up some new
rules or something? After all, he's lost on time!' I replied in Russian that
there was a controller for that, but she held up the fingers of both hands:
that was how my wife had been counting the moves. --- We reconstructed the
score, and it turned out that Black had indeed not managed to make his 40th
move. My opponent took my scoresheet, rewrote it, and showed that he had made... 42 moves. It turned out that Adamski had simply added a repetition of moves,
which was quite ridiculous: the controller confirmed that there had been no
repetition. --- Then a decision was made by a commission of appeal, which, on
the basis of the 'eye-witness evidence' of a whole series of participants,
confirmed the loss on time. --- Much was written about this, even in the pages
of the Polish non-chess press. Adamski complained a great deal, but the end of
this episode amused me. The game appeared in The Chess Player with notes by
Adamski, and the total number of moves 42, so I maintain the right to make an
equally bare-faced falsification of the truth, and am 'preparing' to have
published one of my wins from a simultaneous display as a game Tal-Adamski. In
the end, this will be just as much the 'truth'.} 1-0

{In order to conclude the tale of the Lublin Tournament, I should also say
that there was no real battle for first place, but my wife, unlike her husband,
is very jealous as regards the position of Tal in the FIDE rating list, and
after consultations with the chief controller and some calculations, she
revealed that in order to maintain my rating I required not just first place,
but 12½ points out of the 15 possible. When, partly giving in to her
insistence, I won in the 13th round, she guiltily informed me that she had
apparently made a mistake, and that 12 points would suffice. I 'promised' her
that I would lose one of my games, but all the same finished with two quick
draws. --- I hardly had time to return to Riga before I set off for the Team
Championship of the Soviet Union with the 'Daugava' team. We were one of the
outsiders, and everyone thought that we would be one of the teams to drop out
of the Premier League. Almost all our opponents had ratings much superior to
ours. --- Who could have guessed that, apart from the teams roughly equal to
us, 'Moldova' and 'Zenit', the other team to drop out of the Premier League
would be 'Lokomotiv', headed by Grandmasters such as Spassky, Polugaevsky and
Platonov? But that is what happened. We played concertedly and energetically
and I succeeded in defeating Petrosian with an attack, and had a nice little
finish against Bronstein.} 19. Neg5+ $1 hxg5 20. Nxg5+ Kg8 21. Qf4 Nd7 22. Rxd7

{The result was that I took first place on the top board: among those also
left behind were Spassky, Smyslov, Geller... Within a few days I flew to East
Germany to a tournament in Halle. --- I was already in Berlin before I was
told that the second Soviet participant would be Grandmaster Savon, replacing
Kuzmin, who was unwell. This tournament went much more calmly for me than the
one in Lublin. I drew several games in the first few rounds, in a couple of
which I was the defending side, while my win over Liebert did not make me
particularly happy because it was so unconvincing. --- Then, in the fifth
round, I played a game which did not strengthen my tournament position, but -
and this is much more important - it significantly improved my frame of mind.
This was a game in which I introduced an innovation, according to my opponent 
(a specialist in the Scheveningen Variation) who had published an article on
the move 6 g4 not long before the tournament. Either the innovation was a
success, or else my opponent reacted incorrectly to it, but by move 15 White's
position appeared overwhelming. Then, although I was perfectly well aware that
it was an unnecessary move, and not the best, I sacrificed a bishop so as to
cheer myself up.} 17. Bxd5 ({A 'clean' continuation of the attack would be

magazine Schach. --- Instead of an extra half point, I thus obtained an
excellent supply of optimism, and between the 6th and 13th rounds drew only
two games while winning six. These included an important win over Knaak, which
is given here. This led to me taking the lead, and two draws at the finish
were sufficient to give me first place. --- The tournament was the main, but
by no means the only event, in a chess festival dedicated to the Jubilee of
the German Democratic Republic. Thus I gave several simultaneous displays 
(alone, unfortunately; Savon had to hurry on to Odessa). I particularly recall
my last two appearances on a holiday in Berlin, where I succeeded in playing
the following game.} 1/2-1/2

{It was during these displays that I was informed that essentially I would not
be able to go home. Grandmaster Kholmov could not go to the tournament in Novi
Sad, and it turned out that no one except me could replace him at the last
minute. I would have declined to play in any other event - the surfeit of play
was beginning to tell to some extent - but Yugoslavia was a special case.
After spending just one day at home, I once again set out for the airport. ---
Even so, I arrived only in time for the start of the third round, having found
out on the way that my colleagues in the tournament, Grandmasters Forintos and
Radulov, had so far scored 0 out of 4! Going straight from the 'plane to the
tournament hall, I quickly shared with Radulov the first Grandmaster point.
--- On the following day, my excessively wild play against Kirov led to the
ending of my long unbeaten run, although for a greater part of the game my
opponent was not thinking in terms of more than a draw. Then came a draw in
one of the postponed games (the leaders in the meantime had set a furious pace
and were far ahead) and I began to wonder whether on this occasion my
favourable Yugoslav sky was covered by clouds. However, in the middle of the
tournament I managed to increase my pace, and I scored 5½ points out of 6 at
the finish, and I could assure myself of first place by winning my adjourned
game from the last round against Buljovcic. --- At first glance it appeared
that the adjourned position was a dead draw, but even before the adjournment I
had seen a curious manoeuvre which led by force to a won queen ending. But I
was unable to actually play it. Buljovcic lives some 30 miles from Novi Sad,
and when I arrived for the resumption, instead of my opponent, there was a
telegram awaiting me. Buljovcic apologised, and said that because of a
motoring accident, in which, fortunately, only the car had suffered, he would
be unable to come. I suggested that the position be adjudicated, and the
variation which I demonstrated appeared convincing enough to my main rival in
the battle for first place, Grandmaster Forintos.}) (20. -- {After the
tournament I spent some two more weeks in Yugoslavia. First I gave some
displays, and then came the traditional match between Soviet and Yugoslav
players, played on the Scheveningen System [Editor's note: Every member of
each team plays against every member of the opposing team.] with six players
to each team. This is usually a match between the two countries, but at first
it was decided to call it Moscow-Belgrade. Since there were only two
Muscovites in our team, we appropriated an incomprehensible name: Combined
Team of USSR Clubs. We could not simply call ourselves the USSR Team, since
most of our leading Grandmasters were not playing. --- To be honest, I was
intending to have something of a rest during this match, and was counting on
there being a reserve player, but there turned out not to be one, and I had to
play in every round. I won one game, against Ivkov, who committed a
70-year-old theoretical mistake, and the remainder were not particularly
fighting draws. --- We nevertheless won the match. --- It is not at all
surprising that for the main event of the year - the USSR Championship Premier
League - I arrived extremely tired. Here there were many young players,
playing energetically and as equals with more experienced Grandmasters. --- As
usual I lost in the first round to Polugaevsky, but then managed to win
several games, including one against Dvoretsky, which won the best game prize,
and which is given here. --- With a successful run in the middle of the
tournament - during which I played the game against Taimanov given here - I
took the lead. True, the first alarm signal was also heard: in my game with
Vaganian, in a completely won position, I carelessly fell into a cunningly
prepared trap.}) (20. -- {JOURNALIST. It often happens that you are leading,
or are trying to catch a leader. Which is easier? --- CHESS PLAYER. The latter,
of course, since there is an additional stimulus. --- Besides, for me it is
more pleasant to be trying to catch up. If they are chasing me, then the thing
that happened in this USSR Championship in Leningrad is what frequently occurs.
--- In the penultimate round I played Beliavsky, who was performing very
successfully, and who, together with Vaganian, was a point behind me. Simple
logic suggested that as White I should play quietly for a draw, and that's all.
A somewhat prejudiced attitude to youth forced me to fight not for 'my' gold
medal, but 'for the honour' of my chess generation. As a result I overlooked
one move by my opponent, and from being in my favour, the position became
level, then worse, and after a further mistake - lost. --- There were now two
of us in front, and level is how Beliavsky and I finished up. --- Once again a
year ended, and once again there began a lengthy pause. True, I studied chess,
but not altogether in my usual way: at the request of Anatoly Karpov I spent
some time with him, for we believed that the Fischer-Karpov match would take
place ...}) *

{At the beginning of April the position regarding the World Championship
became clear, and I set off to the tournament in Las Palmas. A very
interesting and unusual resort, but... Not only the old hands of the
tournament, who were taking part for the fourth time, but even the local
residents could not remember such cold weather at that time of the year. The
mean April temperature in Las Palmas is 20~/=C, whereas for us it was around
14~/=C. There was no question of any bathing or long walks. --- About half of
the participants in the tournament were contenders for the top places - all
were Grandmasters of excellent repute, and with a high Elo coefficient. The
other half could objectively only hope for isolated sensational success, and
that is how it worked out. --- The game with Mecking gave me a poor start to
the tournament. Twice I committed inaccuracies, then equalised the position,
but not long before the first time control 'found' almost the only losing move.
--- The furious start by Grandmaster Ljubojevic settled the question of first
place several rounds before the finish. Just when I gained some illusory hopes
of catching him, I overlooked a mate against Olafsson, again on the back rank,
just as in the Alekhine Memorial Tournament. --- From my games I can pick out
the attack against Pomar, and the following encounter, which was awarded a
special prize for the most interesting game of the tournament.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3

{When football interferes with work... --- The seventh round of the Olympiad
Preliminaries. The USSR team is confidently leading in its group. Their next
opponent is the Mongolian team. One of the federations - football or chess -
has made a hash of things. 'Is it really necessary for the Chess Olympiad and
the Football World Cup to be played at the same time?', gloomily joked
football supporters from various countries, who had gathered in Nice on chess
matters. There were various degrees of distraction. Thus the leader of the
Brazilian players, H. Mecking, preferred to spend his playing time by the
television screen, and his team was awarded a loss by default. Others,
fortunately, were more restrained. Other things being equal they were not

{Up till the sixth round, in which this game was played, the two players had
made a pretty poor showing. This applies in particular to the Dutch master
playing White: his column in the tournament table showed a string of five
successive noughts. It has long been known that such an opponent is doubly
dangerous (this is shown by the following rounds, where Bohm scored two
successive wins), since his series is always liable to come to an end.} 1. d4 {
