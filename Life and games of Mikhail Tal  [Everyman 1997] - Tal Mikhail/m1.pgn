{Mikhail Tal, the 'magician from Riga,' was the greatest attacking World
Champion of them all, and this enchanting autobiography chronicles his
extraordinary career with charm and humour. Dazzling games are interspersed
throughout with anecdotes and witty self-interviews, and in typically
objective fashion he related both the downs and ups of his encounters. An
inveterate smoker and drinker, Tal's life on the circuit was punctuated by
bouts in the hospital with kidney problems, but nothing could dull his love
for chess and his sheer genius on the chessboard. His illustrious tournament
record, up to his death in 1992, is included here in full, along with 100
complete games and nearly as many positions. Tal's annotations in this book
are a world apart from ordinary games collections. No reader could fail to be
swept along by his passion and vitality as he sets the scene for an encounter
and then recounts every psychological twist and turn.} 1. -- {The legendary
Mikhail Tal was the finest ever exponent of attacking chess. His all-out
sacrificial style took him all the way to the World Championship title. Dogged
by ill-health, Tal's reign was a short one, and he was never able to regain
his crown, but Tal remained an outstanding player right up to his death in
1992. His departure has taken away one of the chess world's most charismatic
figures; a player who excited chess passions wherever he went.} *

{Mikhail Tal was a remarkable man. His brilliant successes in the years
leading up to his World Championship victory excited the chess world; his very
name became synonymous with brilliance and attacking flair. 'Misha' had a warm
and engaging personality without a hint of malice. His enthusiasm for the game
he loved was unquenchable. In his later years he was afflicted by severe
health problems which would have crushed a lesser man, but he never complained
about his difficulties and continued to play chess right up to his death.
Misha hated to postpone a game; even if he had to slip out of his doctors'
grasp, he would try to make it somehow. Despite his fragile appearance, his
attacking powers and astonishingly quick sight of the board remained intact.
--- My last visit to him was in May 1992, just after he had returned from
Barcelona, his last major tournament. He 'showed' me his fine win against
Lautier, but was so weak that he had to lie on his back and dictate the moves
and analysis 'blindfold' to me, while I played them over on a board. He died
on 28th June 1992, and the chess world is a much poorer place for his absence.
} 1. -- {I was delighted to be asked by Cadogan Books to work on a new edition
of his classic book The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, which covers his career
up to 1975. This is one of those rare chess books which is not only splendidly
instructive, but also conveys a real impression of the author's personality.
--- There was relatively little for me to do apart from convert the moves to
algebraic notation. I corrected some obvious misprints and errors (the
incorrect diagram for the game fragment on page 61 and the missed mate in one
in the analysis of game 90 are typical examples). In some cases there were
errors caused by misprints, for instance the accidental omission of moves. I
have corrected these without comment (just as an example, I have mentioned one
as a footnote on page 150). Likewise, in about 20 academic cases, I have
tidied up the end of a variation. I do not doubt that Tal would have agreed to
these changes had he still been alive to go over the proofs. If there was any
doubt about the analysis, or if the change was in any way significant, my
remark appears as a footnote. --- To avoid confusion, I should explain that
footnotes which are marked 'Editor's note' and 'Translator's note' are
transcribed from the RHM edition. The unattributed footnotes are mine and
appear for the first time in this edition.} (1. -- {John Nunn, Chertsey, June

{The chess world owes Cadogan Books plc a debt of gratitude for undertaking
the monumental task of bringing this classic work by Mikhail Tal back into
print. Since being first published in 1976 by RHM, and never reprinted due to
the subsequent collapse of the publisher, a whole generation has grown up who
have never even seen a copy. Yet The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal is quite
probably the greatest chess book ever written. I am sure that everybody
involved in the initial edition will be delighted that Tal's masterpiece is
once again available to lovers of chess world-wide. --- In this respect we
must thank David Levy (the original editor), and everyone else involved in
RHM's pioneering original edition. All of the game annotations are by Tal
himself, except for games 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 29 (done jointly
by Tal and Koblents, his Latvian trainer) and games 87, 88 and 92 (done
jointly by Tal and Kirilov).} 1. -- {For this marvellous new algebraic version,
Grandmaster John Nunn spent weeks transcribing the material from descriptive
notation, checking the text and deciphering unintelligible variations. Ken
Neat (who did so much fine translation work on the original version) has
retranslated games 33 and 34 from Russian especially for this edition, and has
also fully updated Tal's tournament and match record.} (1. -- {Murray Chandler,

{Dialogue between a chess player and a journalist - (instead of an
autobiography)} 1. -- {Dramatis personae: A CHESS PLAYER. Mikhail Tal --- A
JOURNALIST. Who knows, perhaps alias ...} (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Well now, 'Shall
we begin?'. Did you think, on first sitting down at the chessboard, that you
would at some time playa match for the World Championship? Incidentally, what
do you recall of your first game? --- CHESS PLAYER. Did I think... Probably
not. Matches for the World Championship are fairly rare events, and from the
physical point of view it is simply not possible for many chess fans to take
part in them. I say fans, because, after all, even professionals are chess
fans. --- But about my first game. When one of us first plays chess, he is
like a man who has already caught a dose of microbes of, say, Hong Kong' flu.
Such a man walks along the street, and he does not yet know that he is ill. He
is healthy, he feels fine, but the microbes are doing their work. ---
Something similar, though less harmful, occurs in chess. You have just been
shown that the knight moves like the Russian letter _|_, the bishop diagonally,
the castle (note, the castle, not the rook) in a straight line, while the
queen (once again not the fyerzl [Translator's note: 'Fyerz', derived from
Indian, is the special Russian chess term for the queen.], but the queen!) -
likes her own colour. You lose the first game. But at some time, if your
father or elder brother or simply an old friend wants to be kind to you, then
you win, and as a result feel very proud of yourself. A few days pass, and
suddenly you involuntarily begin to sense that, without chess, there is
something missing in your life. Then you may rejoice: you belong to that group
of people without a natural immunity to the chess disease... --- This is the
way we all begin. And then - the same road; for some it is smooth, for others
less so. But when you sit down to play a match for the World Championship,
then sometimes you recall that first game. --- I lost my first serious game.
To my cousin. And when, for the first time in my life, I fell into 'scholar's
mate', it was a real tragedy, because at that time I considered myself to be
an experienced player. The fact is that my elders were extremely kind, and
while learning I had many more 'victories' to my credit than defeats. --- And
then this tragedy. The first in the whole of my 10 years... --- Then, for
some completely different reason - it seems that I wanted to join a drama
group - I entered the Riga Palace of Pioneers. In the corridor I suddenly
noticed a sign on one of the doors: 'Chess Section'. Excellent!, I thought.
I'll go in and say to the man who is helping the others that my feelings have
been hurt, and he will teach me and show me how to win. --- I went in. I
wasn't shown anything straight away, but I stayed. I stayed, and became
fascinated, perhaps because I was very fortunate with my first chess teacher.
His name, Yanis Kruzkop, will not be familiar to many chess players. But he
has done a great deal for chess, since in all his pupils he has implanted, to
put it stylistically, a whole-hearted love for the game. --- After a few
months of lessons I began winning against my elder brother. But - what a
terrible thing - in doing so I did not feel any particular satisfaction, for I
saw that he was not playing well. The time had come to seek stronger opponents
...}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Would you recall for us, please, all your first
games; the first in a tournament, the first against a master; the first to
appear in print. --- CHESS PLAYER. Of course I first played against a master
in a simultaneous display. The young master Ratmir Kholmov, who had just made
a very successful appearance in the 1947 International Chigorin Memorial
Tournament, came to Riga, and therefore we were all highly intrigued. I won in,
as it then seemed to me, combinative style (see the following game).}) *

{My first serious tournament was the Riga Youth Championship. At that time I
had a fourth category rating, obtained at the Pioneers' Palace. It was a
pretty low rating, but according to some unofficial data I was considered to
be a promising player, and was allowed into the Championship. --- I started
very well: three out of three. But then for the first, and, unfortunately, not
the last time, I had to go directly from the tournament to hospital on account
of scarlet fever. And on the same day that this occurred, a mass match over
100 boards was held in Riga between adults and young players. I played
somewhere around board 45, and an indication of the way I was feeling can be
gained from the fact that I was mated as White in about 8 moves. Incidentally,
it was one of my three starting wins which first appeared in print, in the
All-Union youth magazine Zatyeynik.} 19. Rf6 $1 {(A blockading sacrifice, by

No, I didn't - but I was very pleased with it!} (25. -- {JOURNALIST. And had
you reached the level where you would dream about games or adjourned
positions? --- CHESS PLAYER. This happened to me even a little earlier, in
1947, and turned out excellently! In one of the innumerable tournaments at the
Pioneers' Palace I adjourned a game against Krapivner, a second category
player, in what I then considered to be a hopeless position. That evening I
tried everything I could in the position, for the resumption was the following
morning. I could find nothing, and so I decided that I would go in and resign.
But during the night I dreamed about some unintelligible idea connected - I
remember this clearly - with the adjourned game. On resumption I thought for
some 10 minutes, and found it! --- But then, unfortunately, I dropped below
'that level', and never again in my life have I dreamed about an adjourned
game. --- Then, by-passing the third category, I succeeded in gaining the
second category rating in my next tournament, and I now began to take a real
interest in chess. And if we are still talking about 'firsts', then I must
recall my first departure from Riga to the 'International', as we then proudly
considered it, Tournament of Pioneers' Palaces of the three Baltic Republics.
We had to travel to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. --- Our team was the
youngest there. I, for instance, was only 12 years old. And in my first game
against the Estonians my opponent was a very adult-looking 16-17 year old.
Evidently the Estonian players had come only to win, which would explain the
fact that their team was not altogether made up of Pioneers. And it was not at
all surprising that the Riga team took last place, while on second board I
scored only one point out of four. But it was this point that proved decisive,
since I won against the Estonian player, and as a result the home team took
first place. Probably because of this, for the first time in my life, I was
awarded the prize for the most interesting game of the event, although I was
highly sceptical about my creative success. The prize - a luxurious edition of
Aleksei Tolstoy's book Peter the First - was very fine, but terribly heavy.
And when it was presented to me, it seemed only slightly easier to drag it
back to the table where our team was sitting, than it had been to win the
award-winning game... --- In the next year, 1949, I took part in official
All-Union events for the first time, when I played for the Latvian youth team
in the Championship of the Soviet Union. Incidentally, during the six years
that my age allowed me to take part in youth events, I progressed from the
last to the first board in our team. In my first game - it was in the match
with Byelorussia - I won, but this success proved to be my only one. I recall
a curious encounter from the tournament with the Lithuanian candidate master
Mendeleevsky, which at one point shook my youthful belief in the
irreproachability of the elite. --- The point is that a year earlier in the
Match-Tournament for the World Championship, Botvinnik had sacrificed a pawn
in the Slav Defence, and had won very nicely against Euwe. At that time I
frequently played this opening, and during the game I established the fact
that Mendeleevsky and I were conscientiously following the steps of Botvinnik
and Euwe. In addition, I recalled very well that the theorists had condemned
the pawn capture, and had recommended another move instead. In particular,
Botvinnik had stated this in his notes to the game. And at the board I thought
for a very long time, trying to disprove Botvinnik, because I thought to
myself: surely Euwe, such an expert on theory, couldn't have made a mistake.
In the end, 'boldly' following the Dutch Ex-World Champion, I also obtained a
lost position, and lengthy thought led to my first loss on time and, thank God,
this was the only one in all my years of chess.}) (25. -- {JOURNALIST. Does
this mean that your 'single combat' with the World Champion began at this
point? Or should account be taken of the summer of 1948, when you set off with
a chessboard to play against Botvinnik, who had arrived on holiday? --- CHESS
PLAYER. This story is widely known, and I always smile, however many times I
hear it. But it is evidently time to explain that it is merely a story. It is
true that Botvinnik, after winning the World Championship, took a holiday by
the sea at Riga. I knew about this and wanted to play against him, but there
the truth ends. When I told my family of my intentions they gently dissuaded
me from issuing a challenge to the World Champion. But then your journalistic
colleagues heard about it, and immediately 'placed' a chessboard under my arm,
sent me off to play Botvinnik, and - how can there be any intrigue without
women! - introduced into the act a woman, who barred my way at the World
Champion's door. --- In the following Youth Championship of the country I was
already playing on a higher board for Latvia, and on this occasion I was
taught an instructive lesson. We had to play a preliminary match with our
contemporaries from the Russian Federation, for which we travelled to
Yaroslavl. My opponent was a strong player, the very likeable Victor
Golenishev, a future master. Our first game progressed with changing fortunes,
and was adjourned in an ending slightly inferior for me. But analysis
disclosed that I could obtain by force a position with a knight against two
bishops, and nothing else on the board. --- Only relatively recently, eighteen
months to two years previously, had I learned to give mate to a lone king with
two bishops, and, naturally, did not suspect that, having a knight, I would
face any difficulties. Therefore, when this position was reached, I began
trying to catch my opponent's eye, expecting an offer of a draw. But play went
on, and still no offer, and after 10-12 moves I began to sense that it was not
at all so simple. In the end I lost the game, and only managed to gain my
revenge 11 years later in my second match with Botvinnik, when I won a similar
ending (Translator's note: 17th Match game, 1961.). --- A striking example of
the benefit of youth tournaments! --- On that occasion, in Yaroslavl, we did
not reach the final. But in the following year, as a result of a very
interesting trip to Kishinyev - I had never before been so far away from home,
and people looked at us as foreigners - we reached the final, since we
defeated the Moldavian lads. There I played what was evidently the first
successful ending in my life. Everyone thought that the bishop ending where I
was a pawn up would be a draw, but we managed to find an interesting bishop
manoeuvre which gave White a forced win.}) 1-0

playing on board four, and enjoyed at that time the reputation of a
hussar-like tactician, always ready to sacrifice something. But here, taking
into account the team's interests, our captain advised me to play quietly and
reservedly. The results were immediately apparent! In the very first round,
playing White in a well-known variation of the Caro-Kann Defence, I sacrificed
a pawn according to theory - I considered that I had the right to do this -
but then the normal continuation of the attack was to sacrifice two further
pawns, and, in some cases, a rook. Bearing in mind what my captain had said, I
began looking for a peaceful solution to the position, got into time-trouble
and lost. This happened every time that I attempted to play reservedly and
accurately. It was only when my opponents themselves thrust wild complications
upon me, and I could not avoid them, that I was successful. --- Besides, I
already considered myself to be quite an experienced player. At the end of
1950 I had made my debut in the adult Championship of Riga. In the quarter-
final I scored 12½ out of 13, and reached the first category norm, then
from the semi-final I went through to the final. I finished the Championship
with 9 points out of 19, somewhere in the region of 11th-14th places. However,
it was something else that was rather curious. --- There were two masters
playing in the final - Alexander Koblents from Riga, my future trainer, and,
hors concours, the Muscovite Evgeny Zagoryansky, together with five candidate
masters and 13 first category players. Against the masters I scored 1½
points, and was pleased with my defence of a difficult position against
Zagoryansky. My score against the candidates was 3½, but against my fellow
first category players - 4 out of 12! --- Nevertheless, I got through to the
Latvian Championship, although this was my fourth tournament in a row and
perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to my school work,
especially since the third quarter of the school year was finishing. --- The
tournament began not at all badly for me. In the first round I saved my game
against Strautmanis in a way that I liked then, and still do - I fell into a
trap, so as to then catch my opponent in it. I got into a difficult position
as Black, but then found a combination, apparently overlooking a tactical blow,
but in fact winning my opponent's queen for rook and bishop by force. The game
finished as a draw. In the second round I fairly quickly defeated the Liepaya
player Gravitis, but then in the third round came a tragedy which thoroughly
upset me. In my game against the candidate master Zhdanov I played, as I still
consider, quite well. As Black in the Marshall Attack I carried out a fairly
interesting combination. --- I allowed my opponent to obtain a second queen
with check, but when he did this, it became clear that his position was quite
hopeless; then, in an elementary won position, thinking that I could win just
as I pleased, I simply blundered away a piece. There was still a draw to be
had, but I completely went to pieces at this sudden turn of events, and lost
the game. Following this I lost several more games, practically without a
struggle, so that about six rounds from the finish I was firmly seated in one
of the bottom places. But towards the end the spring holidays began. School
gave me, as it were, time out to regain my strength, and in the remaining
games I gained some five points, so that for the second successive time I
shared 11th-14th places with 9 points out of 19.} (63. -- {JOURNALIST. Were
you thinking at this time about your chess future; not about the World
Championship title, of course, but at least of the title of master? --- CHESS
PLAYER. I'm afraid that this may now sound coquettish, but at that time I
simply played chess and gained pleasure from it.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. But
surely you wanted to do battle with famous players? --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, of
course, I very much enjoyed doing so. Even at that time I was occasionally
able to do this, though only in simultaneous displays. --- My first such
encounter was with Keres, our neighbour from the north, our idol. He came to
give a simultaneous display against us, and although he was engaged at that
time in the battle for the chess crown, I considered it unethical to play
against him in a normal display. I was, after all, a finalist in the Latvian
Championship, a solid first category player. So I put my name down for a
display with clocks, which Keres gave on 10 boards. --- He suffered two
defeats - at the hands of future grandmasters Gipslis and myself. And I was
very pleased with this game, not so much because I won, but more because I
defeated Keres in the Botvinnik Variation. I thought that psychologically this
would be a terrible shock for him, since Keres and Botvinnik were always
considered to be, as it were, fundamental opponents at the chessboard. Time
passed. Paul Petrovich and I played together in tournaments for several years.
Once I asked him whether he remembered our first encounter. Yes, he replied,
in Tallinn, in the match between Latvia and Estonia. No, I told him, earlier,
in Riga, in a simultaneous display. Here Paul Petrovich admitted that he had
completely forgotten this game - and I had thought that a defeat in the
Botvinnik Variation would remain in his memory for ever... --- In the
following year, 1952, once again in the Latvian Championship, I acquired that
very nice habit, which is still with me, of losing my first game. Since this
occurred in the opening 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bd3 (??) Nf6 4 c3 where I was
playing Black, I was upset and gained a further two noughts almost straight
away. Then things turned for the better, I finished up in 7th place, and
inflicted the only defeat on the Latvian Champion Pasman. --- In the Youth
Championship of the Country our team had its usual troubles, while I was also
concerned about the problem of my further education. I finished school at the
age of fifteen and a half, since previously I had been accepted directly into
the third year. I sent my application to the Law Faculty of the University,
but they pointed out to me that I would finish University when I was 20, and
according to the law I could be a Public Assessor, or fulfil certain other
juridical functions, only from the age of 21, so after University I would have
a year of enforced idleness. Then special permission was received from the
Ministry in Moscow, from which it appeared that I had the right to study at
the Philological Faculty. I heard about this during the Youth Championships. I
loved literature and had nothing against the idea. I flew home, passed the
exam, and registered. --- Towards the end of the same year, I played for the
first time in an adult team 'Daugavi' - which took part in group two of the
USSR Championship. Incidentally, an amusing incident occurred there: I played
a game, the result of which I do not know to this day. --- It was in the final
round. I got into a bad position, but on resumption succeeded in confusing
matters, and my opponent, losing his head in time-trouble, began to repeat
moves. The repetition was somewhat veiled, but the same position occurred
three times. In accordance with the rules, I did not make my 55th move, but
called the chief controller, and asked him to record the draw. But my opponent,
in a very loud stentorian-like voice, said that I was a boy, that I had no
idea of what was meant by repetition of position, and showed the controller
his scoresheet. --- The controller took a quick glance, said that there had
been no repetition, and told us to play on. My opponent emerged from
time-trouble, then realised his advantage and won. Later I went up to the
assistant chief controller, and asked him to explain things. We quickly set up
the position, and decided that the repetition had occurred. What was I to do?
Shortly afterwards, while I was wondering whether or not to submit a protest,
the chief controller came up to me with tables in his hand, and began trying
to persuade me that the game was of no great importance' that all the same our
team would take third place, that all the same I would not win the individual
tournament on my board, so that on the whole there was no point in creating a
fuss. --- He went away, whereupon the other controllers came up and said that
the chief controller had offended them, and that I should submit a protest. So
I wrote one out, but then our train left, and therefore to this day I do not
know the control team's decision.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. And who was the chief
controller? --- CHESS PLAYER. Is it important? On a couple of subsequent
occasions he was the chief controller of tournaments where I was playing. And
both times, for some reason, I forgot to ask him what had been the result of
that game... --- But, to be honest, I very quickly forgot about it.
Especially since I soon gained my first real success: in the Latvian
Championship I took first place. Mind you, I couldn't avoid doing so. The
point was that from 1951, each year for a period of five years, the
Championship of the Republic was won 'according to tradition' by a first-year
student from the University. In 51 Pasman from the Faculty of History, in 52
Klyavin from Physics-Mathematics, in 54 Klovans from the Faculty of Economics,
and in 55 Gipslis, so that when in 1953 I was the only first-year in the
Championship, victory came 'of its own accord'. I played well, although I lost
to the master Koblents in a game which he remembers to this day. --- In that
game I played the opening badly, but then he missed a tactical stroke, and in
addition had very little time left on his clock, but here, in his time
pressure, I played 'a tempo', and lost my queen. With his flag raised,
Koblents made his 39th move, got up and prepared to walk away, thinking that
the control had been reached. I warned him that he was mistaken. Koblents was
most mistrustful of my words, but all the same he sat down and made another
move a few seconds before the fall of his flag, whereupon I resigned. He then
checked his scoresheet, found the mistake in it, and 'began to respect' me.
--- By the way, at that moment we two were the only real challengers for first
place, but then the Maestro, as Koblents was called by everyone, dropped back
somewhat... --- Youth as a whole did well in the tournament, so that when, in
the autumn, after the Youth Championship of the Country where I succeeded in
playing the fairly lively game against Birbrager given here, we set off for
the Adult Team Championship of the USSR, the Latvian team appeared
unexpectedly young, with 16 year-olds Tal and Gipslis, and 17 year-old Klovans.
Only our leader, Koblents, and one other player, could be called experienced
fighters. It was to Koblents that the witty Lithuanian master Vistanestskis
addressed himself - 'What are you doing? It is after 1st September, and time
for children to be at school, and you are making them play chess!' Taking into
account our previous rather poor performances, few saw us as potential
finalists. --- We played with great enthusiasm, and not only reached the final,
but even took fourth place there, ahead of the weakened, but nevertheless
formidable, Ukrainian team. On the third board Klyavin played splendidly, and
as a result gained the master title. I also reached the master norm, but the
All-Union Classification Committee considered it inexpedient to give the title
straight away to two members of the same team (and on board 2 I had gained
less points than Klyavin). Instead I was granted the right to play a
qualifying match with the then practically permanent Champion of Byelorussia,
the master Vladimir Saigin. --- From the team tournament, the game with
Korchnoi sticks in my memory; it was our first game. We played each other
twice, but it was our first encounter in the opening round of the semi-final
which so affected the score between us, which, as is well known, is not at all
in my favour. --- Before the start of play I was naturally nervous: at that
time Korchnoi was already considered to be a certain candidate for the
grandmaster title. In an Alekhine Defence I obtained the better position, then
saw a chance to increase the pressure, and a forced variation. I went in for
it and... adjourned the game with a minimal advantage for my opponent. On
resumption I defended stubbornly, but all the same resigned towards the end of
the first hundred moves. There was some consolation in the fact that in the
final Korchnoi finished below me.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. At that time you were
already having to play fairly important, and sometimes decisive, games. How
did you manage in them? --- CHESS PLAYER. At that time not very well,
especially in team events when I was tortured by a sense of heightened
responsibility. I tried to restrain myself, but to play 'not your own game',
to play against yourself, is always difficult and unpleasant. Later, within
eighteen months to two years, I began to succeed in decisive games, perhaps
because I realised a very simple truth: not only was I worried, but also my
opponent. --- The year 1954 began for me with my first tournament game against
a Grandmaster, none other than Keres. We travelled to Tallinn for the
traditional friendly match, in which there was normally a hard battle on the
men's boards, while on the two women's boards the ladies from Estonia always
defeated ours. For some reason I, and not Koblents, was on board one, and when
it became known that Keres would be playing, my team-mates gloomily joked that
the number of our ladies' boards had become three: boards nine, ten and one.
--- The surprises, some of them really touching, began as early as the station
in Tallinn, when among those there to meet us we saw Keres. We, who were
mainly lads, were taken in his car to the hotel, and for literally each of us
he found a friendly, welcoming smile. --- The first round was played that
evening. Our game began with the King's Indian Defence, and I remember that on
the 6th move I had a strong urge to exchange queens. However, I did not want
to play openly for a draw, and later I realised that I would have been
unlikely to gain one against such a virtuoso as Keres. --- At a later stage I
played sharply, Keres seized the initiative, and I admired the way that, in
time-trouble, he left himself literally 3-5 seconds for his last move, and,
having worked everything out, captured my piece, not fearing the series of
checks which then commenced. Of course I lost the adjourned game, but I drew
the second as Black, finding an unexpected move in a somewhat inferior ending.}
) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. But all the same, you were a candidate master, whereas
Keres was number two or three in the world. Wasn't it frightening? --- CHESS
PLAYER. No, it was very interesting.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. And have you never
been afraid of anyone? --- CHESS PLAYER. Before a game with Korchnoi, for
instance, or with Spassky or Keres, against whom the score is clearly not in
my favour, I might be nervous, feel uncomfortable or even afraid, but on
sitting down at the board, I would forget about everything: I would become
engrossed in the game.}) (63. -- {JOURNALIST. Did you ever head for a draw
from the very first move? --- CHESS PLAYER. In all my life, only once. In the
1955 USSR Team Championship Semi-final, playing White against Korchnoi, after
the moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5, I captured on d5. I was terribly ashamed, and from
that time I swore: to play for a draw, at any rate with White, is to some
degree a crime against chess. --- After the team match, the Latvian
Championship was held. I was 'physically' unable to win it, since I was now in
my second year of study, and I shared second and third places with Gipslis.
Then in the summer I played the match with Saigin. At that time, in testing us,
the Chess Federation was rather careful in its choice of examiners for those
seeking the master title. It may be recalled that, a few months before
becoming a Grandmaster and a candidate for the World Championship, Petrosian
played such a match, as did Kholmov a little later. --- My match with Saigin
proceeded in a very lively fashion. To this day the impression has not left me
that at some point the Byelorussian master simply felt sorry for me, and
played the last few games at only half strength. The first game, which was
very interesting, ended in a draw. Just at that time we were studying the
so-called Belgrade Gambit, and in the Pioneers' Palace we rehearsed the most
interesting and head-spinning variations. --- Of course, the decision to make
this opening my main weapon as White against Saigin was clearly attributable,
in the main, to the fact that I was only eighteen years old. In the second
game I was a little careless in the opening, and lost in 17 moves. I won the
third with roughly the same 'speed'. Then came a series of draws which we each
secured in turn. --- The best game of the match was the eighth, which is given
here, and which I won, but the tenth also sticks in my mind. In it the pieces
were so amusingly placed, that you might have thought that it was being played
by beginners!}) 1-0

extra rook. To my misfortune, the idea of a fantastically beautiful win came
into my head. I played for it, the situation grew tense, both kings were
threatened with mate, and suddenly I discovered that the whole point of my
combination lay in the move Bf8-g5 (!!!). Since bishops don't move that way, I
had to resign. --- It was here that I had the unsubstantiated feeling that
Saigin was not especially pleased with such a win, and that he played the next
two games as if he were feeling guilty. I managed to win them and this
terminated the match ahead of schedule, although we also played the final game.

All these attempts of yours to find more complicated wins have cost, and still
cost you, more points than perhaps anyone else in the world. Surely life must
have taught you something? --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, it probably has. Nowadays,
in my opinion, this happens less frequently, but, you see, sometimes an idea
occurs which is so interesting that it proves stronger than me. I can recall
the game with Veltmander from the match Russian Federation-Latvia, 1955, and
that with Sveshnikov from the 1973 USSR Championship. But perhaps it is not
worth recalling them?}) (47. -- {JOURNALIST. Yes, it is! --- CHESS PLAYER.
Then concerning my game with Veltmander: he gave a last, dying check. I could
have moved my king to b2, after which mate in three was inevitable, but from
the aesthetic point of view this for some reason appeared unattractive to me.
I allowed him some play, and with difficulty gained a draw. An unpleasant
situation arose, for I was simply unable to explain to my team-mates what had
happened. True, in my heart I remained faithful to myself, and only regretted
the fact that I had miscalculated. Otherwise everything would have been fine!})
(47. -- {JOURNALIST. The second question: when you were not awarded the master
title, but it was suggested that you play a match, were you offended? ---
CHESS PLAYER. Oh, no... You see, I was so cocky that I thought that if there
was to be a match, then I would win it. --- From the other events of that year
I should like to mention the Youth Team Championship of the Country. I had by
now ascended from last to first board in the Latvian team, and here I played
for the first time against the leader of the Leningrad team, Boris Spassky.
The board one tournament was highly respectable: apart from Spassky and myself
there were future Grandmasters Gufeld and Liberzon, and International Master
Bagirov. Spassky and I had our own special race: he scored 7½ out of 9, and
I half a point less, but I succeeded in carrying out a combination, the idea
of which I found pleasing (see the following game).}) 1/2-1/2

lost more games than I won or drew. --- 1955 was notable for my debut in the

Championship, but I was somehow living in anticipation of greater things, and
regarded it as just an ordinary tournament. Besides, the first-year student

{Then came the USSR Individual Championship, not the final, of course, but
only the quarter-final. The 'quarter' in which I played was called the Baltic
Zonal Tournament, and was strong enough: the chess players from the Baltic and
Byelorussia have always been, as they say, 'in the public eye'. Four of the
eighteen competitors subsequently became Grandmasters. Incidentally, it was
there that for the first time in the All-Union arena (in the Latvian
Championship it had already happened once) I played a tournament game with a
representative of the fairer (also sometimes called the weaker) sex: the USSR
Ladies' Champion Kira Zvorikina scored one point; fortunately, it was not
against me that she won. --- From the creative point of view, the tournament
began very productively for me. Even all the draws - and in the first seven
rounds I had as many as five - were at times simply head-spinning. Then came a
decline and two highly annoying defeats, one of which occurred in the game
with Lein, due to an incident which for me was atypical. He had very little
time remaining, and, thinking over the problem of how to realise my advantage
most quickly, I forgot all about the clock. Suddenly I saw the controllers
approaching. 'What, have they never seen time-trouble?', I thought, and
accidentally glancing at the clock, noticed that my flag was about to fall,
while Lein's minutes remained intact. In some 40 seconds I succeeded in making
all 15 moves to the control, but in my haste the path I followed was not at
all the one over which I had been thinking for so long. --- Be that as it may,
but some 6 or 7 rounds before the finish my chances of success had practically
disappeared. In addition, my next three games were with my colleagues from
Riga, all of whom were above me in the tournament table. However, sport is
sport, and it was necessary to 'step over their dead bodies'. The ending with
Gipslis proved especially interesting. From the start my opponent played
openly for a draw, knowing that this would not satisfy me. What was I to do?
It would be suicide to rush into the attack against White's solid position,
and after thinking over one move for I hour 40 minutes (!!), I voluntarily
went into a difficult, perhaps even lost ending. On the other hand, the
resulting position demanded energetic action on Gipslis' part, but he was
unable to re-adjust, and Black obtained a counter-attack. In the adjourned
position I succeeded in finding a study-like win.} 18... Qe5 19. Nxf6+ gxf6 20.

{At home, in Riga, the Semi-final proved a great surprise to me. Grandmaster
Boleslavsky was playing there, as well as strong and experienced masters such
as Furman and Korchnoi. Against the latter I had a considerably inferior
individual score. Trying to 'win one back', I lost to him from a better
position on the eve of the Semi-final in the Russian Federation-Latvia Match,
and then again in the Semi-final. Up till then I had scored roughly 50%
against him as Black, but would systematically lose to him as White.
Psychology clearly played its part! --- Then, in such a strong tournament as
this, I managed to assure myself of first place with one round to go. Several

{Every experienced chess player (and I, unfortunately, have every right to be
considered one) is familiar with that strange feeling which he has when he
sits down to annotate his early games. On the one hand, he plays through them
with a sort of tenderness, just like an adult watching a film taken by his
parents of his early years or even months, or looking through the fading
photographs from a family album; on the other hand, whether he wants to or not,
on almost every move his hand all but stretches out to attach a question mark.
On the whole, I do not like annotating other people's games. The point is that
I consider that it is very difficult to penetrate into a player's thinking, to
guess the direction of the variations thought out by him, and therefore it is
better to direct one's attention towards one's own games. I prefer to make my
annotations 'hot on the heels', as it were, when the fortunes of battle, the
worries, hopes and disappointments are still sufficiently fresh in my mind.
Much as I would like to, I cannot say this about these few games which will be
given below. In fact, if the annotator should begin to use phrases of the type:
'in reply to... I had worked out the following variation...', the reader will
rightly say 'Grandmaster, you are showing off, since the 'oldest' of these
games is now more than 25 years old, and even the 'newest' more than 20.
Therefore, I would ask you not to regard the following 'stylised' annotations
too severely. --- The game given below was played in the Championship of the
Riga Palace of Pioneers, just at the time when the 'Golden Age' of young
Latvian chess players was beginning. If I remember correctly, A. Gipslis and Y.
Klovans, who were to become quite well known masters within a few years,
played in the Palace, while I was making my usual unsuccessful attempt to
obtain first category rating. On looking through the following game, it will
be easy to see why this attempt was unsuccessful.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 c5
4. exd5 {Up to this point the game has developed in similar fashion to many of
the Karpov-Korchnoi encounters in 1974. However, I don't wish to claim ...}
Qxd5 5. Ngf3 Nc6 6. Bc4 Qh5 {Modern theory takes a sceptical view of this
manoeuvre. However, in the present case I don't consider that any detailed
analysis of the opening system is necessary.} 7. dxc5 $1 {This continuation is
possibly the strongest rejoinder. If we use the 'retrospective method', it can
be supposed that the white player (who at that time already had a reputation
as a tactician) simply did not care for the prospect of the queens being
exchanged at some stage (after the capture on d4).} Bxc5 8. Ne4 Nge7 {Because
of the unpleasant threat of the knight's intrusion on d6, Black cannot keep
his bishop.} 9. Bg5 $1 {I like this move even now; it emphasises the bad
position of the black queen, while keeping the bishop under attack.} Qg4 ({
While there is no denying that this is a clever reply,} 9... b6 {was
nevertheless the lesser evil, although even in this case after} 10. Nxc5 bxc5

critical assessment is by no means a sign of the sceptical attitude of a
venerable Grandmaster to his young inexperienced namesake. If I had had to
annotate this game 25 years ago, the verdict would have been the same.} ({It
is difficult to believe that White should miss the chance to win the game
immediately using 'arithmetic':} 11. h3 Qf5 (11... Qxg2 12. Rh2) 12. g4 Qg6 13.
Nh4 Ne5 14. Bb5+ ({or} 14. Qe2 {.})) 11... O-O {The opponent is still
blissfully unaware.} ({He could have saved his queen by playing} 11... h6 {.})
12. Bf6 {Instead of capturing the queen (the variation given in the previous
note still works), White gives away a piece. No doubt the idea of placing the
bishop en prise appeared so tempting that other possibilities did not occur to
me (unfortunately, this disease from my youth sometimes recurs even now). On
the other hand, if this is the case, then the question arises as to why did
White not play Bf6 a move earlier, when at any rate it was less risky. I am
absolutely sure that my opponent's reply came as a surprise to me, and so,
much as I would like to, I cannot place this game in the category of
'intuitive' or 'Tal' sacrifices.} Qf4+ 13. Kb1 gxf6 {The situation has changed
'somewhat'. Black has an extra bishop, for which I now do not see any
compensation at all. On the other hand, it was not difficult to detect that
the black king's pawn cover had been weakened. White continues as if nothing
has happened.} 14. g3 Qh6 15. g4 Qf4 {The most logical. On this square the

{'Lucky Tal' - I have often been called this by journalists. It must be
admitted that there is a certain justification for such a nickname. After an
event, certain players like to indulge in an unusual form of statistics; they
count up the points that stand alongside their names in the tournament table,
and also those that could have been. As a rule, the number 'lost' is
significantly higher than the number 'found'. I cannot say this about myself.
Very often carelessness or indifferent technique has prevented me from
achieving victory in positions which one can confidently regard as being won,
but there have also been a number of examples of a different sort. From my
very first steps in chess I have been an 'optimist'. I think that the reader
will already have realised this, after playing through my game with Zilber.
The example given below is of the same type. On this occasion, it is true, the
ratings of the players were higher - both had first category. Moreover, if one
looks ahead, the following games come to mind: the 3rd and 4th games with
Smyslov in the 1959 Candidates Tournament, the 3rd and 17th games from the
first match with Botvinnik (incidentally, the second of these is the most
similar to the game which the reader can now see), and the game with Portisch
in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal. This list could easily be extended if one so
desired. --- There is no doubt that my opponents in these games had every
justification for complaining about their bad luck. I hope, however, that I in
some way 'contributed' to this bad luck.} 1. d4 f5 2. e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3
{My opponent was very fond of accepting pawn sacrifices. Thus he regularly

pawn on c3 and be prepared to defend for a long time for the sake of it. In

{The game given below was played in the tournament which brought me my first
really important success. There was always a very tense struggle for the
Latvian Championship, and to take first place in it was a far from easy matter.
Running ahead a little, I remember how in 1958 the twice Champion of the USSR
M. Tal had to be satisfied with third place in the Championship of the
Republic. However, in the 1953 Championship I was the undisputed favourite.
This had nothing to do with chess strength - at that time I had first category
rating, while there was one master and about 10 candidate masters in the
tournament, or, to express it in the modern way, my individual rating was far
from being the highest. Simply, commencing in 1951, there was an unwritten
tradition in our Championships that the winner should be a first-year student.
In 1951 it was M. Pasman, in 1952 Y. Klyavin, and in 1953 I was the only
first-year taking part. Following the same tradition, the next year Y. Klovans
took first place, and then A. Gipslis. I succeeded in repeating my achievement
in the Championship only 12 years later, when the tradition had been forgotten,
and young players did not in general reach the final of the Championship of
the Republic. --- My opponent was one of the strongest players in Latvia, and
had already successfully competed in the USSR Championship Semi-final. M.
Pasman likes to play to a clearly defined positional plan, and so it was with
particular pleasure that I strove in this game for tactical complications,
reckoning that only in this way could I hope for success.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6
3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {At that time the Najdorf System was only
just coming into fashion.} 6. f4 {This continuation was one of the most
popular at that time. Now, for no particular reason, it is played rather
rarely, although it brings White a high enough percentage of wins. I liked
this move for the main reason that in the 1952 USSR Championship Semi-final in
Riga (M. Pasman played in this tournament) a spectacular game was played. I am
unable to resist the temptation to give it in full. (See the following game)}

threats to his king.}) 17. Bxe7 Qxe7 18. Nd5 Qd6 19. Qg4 {White simply throws

{There are chess players whose opening tastes are noted for their exceptional
constancy. Thus, for instance, in preparing for a game with Fischer (up till
1972), one could have no doubt that, in reply to 1 e4, the Najdorf Variation
of the Sicilian Defence would definitely be played. This was confirmed by
literally all the American Grandmaster's games, beginning with childhood
competitions. Karpov, from his early years, has had a marked antipathy to
Indian set-ups, and in reply to 1 e4 normally chooses 1...e5 (more rarely 1...c5). Other players, such as Spassky, Korchnoi and Larsen, regularly vary their
openings as they think fit. The game given below is one of my first attempts
at playing a complicated opening system, with which subsequently certain
theorists even associated my name. Up till 1953 I normally adopted the Slav
Defence, the Nimzo-Indian and the King's Indian, less frequently the Dutch,
and very rarely the Grünfeld. As far as I remember, in one of the issues of
'Shakhmaty v SSSR' at that time, the game Boleslavsky-Nezhmetdinov from the
Championship of the Russian Republic appeared, in which Black treated the
system with 2...c5 in very interesting fashion. This game appealed to me, and
I began occasionally, and then fairly regularly, to adopt it in tournaments.}

have played against I. Birbrager three times, and three times this system has
appeared. Two years later, in the USSR Team Championship (this time for adults)
, the Uzbekistan player played the opening very accurately, and I think that
it was he who introduced a continuation in one of the topical variations,
which is even nowadays considered to be the strongest. A further 10 years
passed, and once again, also in the USSR Team Championship, I succeeded in
winning a game which was not without theoretical interest (though not as a
result of the opening). To return to our first encounter, it should be noted
that at that time the theory of this variation was at an embryonic stage, and
so there is nothing surprising in the numerous errors made by both players.} 6.

{'A game is not finished until the clocks are stopped'. One would expect this
chess axiom to be clear to everyone. And yet, how many times does it happen
that, in a completely won position, a blunder radically changes everything
that only a minute previously had seemed absolutely clear. Looking back on my
tournament career, I can recall a number of such extreme occurrences. The most
recent of these was in the 42nd USSR Championship, when I allowed undivided
first place to slip from my grasp. It was in my game with Vaganian. The
exchange and a pawn up, I feel puzzled: why does my opponent continue playing?
One slight mistake, a second, more serious one, yet another, and the
miraculous happens - I have to agree to a draw. By all accounts, it is a
premature weakening, a laziness which suddenly occurs at that moment when
there is only a little more to do, and is one of the innate short-comings of a
player which reveals itself fairly frequently. The following game serves (more
accurately, could have served) as evidence of this.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5

catch their opponents in prepared variations. At the time of this game I used

to evacuate his king there at the first opportunity.} d5 {Black's forces are

{Autumn 1954. Riga receives the participants in a most important event - the
Team Championship of the USSR. Petrosian, Taimanov, Averbakh, Korchnoi and
other experienced players lead their delegations. It is easy to imagine the
apprehension of a young player, finding himself for the first time in such
company. Not long before this I had succeeded in winning a classification
match for the title of master against the Byelorussian player V. Saigin by 8-6,
and although formally I took part with the 'rank' of candidate master, the
decision was expected to arrive literally at any day. It is quite natural that
the 'Daugava' team did not place great hopes on the results of its leader.
That is how it worked out in the end - a win in the first round proved to be
the only one. --- Every player has his memorable games and tournaments.
Without doubt, the first board tournament in Riga was the strongest I had
played in, and the game given below was my third encounter with a grandmaster 
(if, of course, you do not include fairly successful performances against them
in simultaneous displays). --- In the spring of the same year I had been
fortunate enough to play against the then legendary Keres in Tallinn, and even
drew one of our two encounters.} 1. e4 e5 (1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {- see

theory as the Belgrade Gambit.} Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nd5 (5. Nd5 Nxe4 6. Qe2 f5 7.

that on his 'home ground' (the Championship was held in Leningrad) it was
Boris who had the support of the spectators; I did not like this, and I played
somewhat strangely: first limply (in the opening), then over-sharply (in the

tournament, the reviewers considered that a share of 5th place was not bad for
a first appearance, but I myself was dissatisfied. Since the Championship, as
has already been said, was weakened, and since the competitors were, in the
main, winners of the Semi-finals like myself, I had hoped to do better. In the
first instance, in the creative sense. Thus, for instance, in my game against
Taimanov, an extra piece proved insufficient to win: I was deceived by the
'shuffling' of the pieces. Although similar 'presents' were also made to me,
one forgets about them, whereas one remembers one's own mistakes for a long
time... --- Soon after the Championship I had my first trip abroad. With the
USSR Student Team I set off for the World Championship in Sweden. There were a
great number of new, colourful impressions, plus the special character of the
'Little Olympiad' - everyone was young and good-humoured, and got on well
together, while the language barrier was overcome 'from the first move' - all
this sticks in my mind for ever. --- From the point of view of the result, our
team, which consisted entirely of future Grandmasters, won easily. I was
awarded the prize for the best result on board 3. Of interest was my game with
Ivkov, which is given here. --- The year 1956 ended somewhat dramatically.
Despite a poor result in the match between Latvia and Estonia, I was
considered favourite for the USSR Championship Semi-final in Tbilisi. I will
not now undertake to explain what was at the bottom of it, but the tournament
turned out to be extremely difficult for me. --- After 12 rounds my column of
the tournament table showed one win (and goodness knows, the victory was not
exactly convincing in an ending with four queens against Kasparian), two zeros
and nine (!!) draws. In addition, the defeats were extremely vexing, being the
result of bad blunders. --- The one thing that cheered me up was a stubborn
and successful defence as Black against Korchnoi in our game from the 12th
round. Once again around the hundred-move mark (!), the game ended in a draw,
and even now I do not know whether it was to this that lowed my spurt at the
finish: 6 out of 7. As a result I succeeded in 'catching hold' of the last
step on the finalists' train departing for Moscow. --- However, it is not
impossible that a part was played by a conversation with my trainer Koblents,
who was appearing in the same Semi-final. He had played well in these 12
rounds to be amongst the leaders, and I jokingly said to him: 'Don't be upset
Maestro! We will still be going to the Final together, only this time I will
be your second'. --- Towards the end Koblents faded, and in the Final
'tradition was maintained'.} *

{On to January 1957. The Championship of the Soviet Union was a strong
tournament and very interesting indeed from the creative point of view. I do
not say this because I succeeded in winning, but because that is how it really
was. Tolush, for instance, gave several brilliant examples of attack; the
experienced Bronstein and Keres played with enthusiasm; and it was here that
the normally reserved Petrosian demonstrated that he was able - and how! - to
play 'open' chess. He lost several (for him) games, but was able to win even
more. I also succeeded in winning several interesting encounters. --- Contrary
to normal practice, the start of the tournament went well for me: the game
with Aronson is given here. Then I won three further games in a row, including
one against the previous year's Champion Taimanov, and my first ever game
against my idol Bronstein, whose play has always been for me an example, and
if you like - a yardstick. The fourth victory, against Bannik, continued the
gallery of my games, already quite long, where my opponent set a trap and I
fell into it, but in doing so I continued the variation for a further few
moves, which allowed me to find a 'hole' in the trap. --- I dropped my first
half point in the fifth round, and, of course, it was in my game with Korchnoi,
while in the sixth round I was drastically punished by Nezhmetdinov for
incorrectly assessing the position. --- The following could have been my best
game in the Championship. After interesting complications this was the
position reached:} 25. Rxb2 {I sacrificed the exchange!} Nxb2 26. Qd5+ Kh8 27.
Qd4 Rxd7 28. Qxd7 Rg8 29. Ng5 h6 30. Nf7+ Kh7 {, and here I thought that in
the variation} 31. Qf5+ g6 32. Qd7 gxh5 33. Ng5+ Kg6 34. Qe6+ Kxg5 35. g3 h4
36. f4+ Kh5 {, I could not play 37 g2(!!!)-g4, because Black would take en
passant. About the fact that the pawn was already on g3, and that the mate by
37 g3-g4 is quite legal, I somehow forgot. --- After the game (not having
found a mate, I quickly won back the exchange and agreed a draw) this was
naturally pointed out to me by Geller, Bronstein, and someone else, and then I
really went to pieces. There followed four draws in a row, which is nothing to
boast about, and then a game against Boleslavsky adjourned in a poor position,
which in the end I lost. --- By the adjournment day my mood improved
significantly, for I succeeded in winning an interesting game against
Petrosian. Then things got better. I managed to defeat Keres (the game is
given in the book), who was leading at the time, in positional style, which
was a surprise even to me, and went ahead together with Bronstein. In the
following round, the 17th, I played a game which brought me half a point,
enormous satisfaction, and a special prize (see the following game).} *

I sacrificed a piece against Gurgenidze and won in 27 moves, then there
followed two draws, so that before the last round three of us were sharing
first place: Bronstein, Tolush and myself. My last round opponent was Tolush,
while Bronstein had to play Kholmov, against whom 'by order' no one won at
that time, so that a draw would assure me of a share of first place. --- I'll
go back just a little. In the penultimate round I had drawn with Kholmov as
Black, while my opponent needed to win in order to reach the Grandmaster norm
for the second and last time. He tried very hard, but around move 30 the
position had become so simplified that I allowed myself to begin peace
negotiations. --- Kholmov very sharply rejected the offer and sank into
thought for an hour, during which time I began imagining all sorts of terrible
things. Then he raised his eyes from the board, said 'Draw!', and we began
analysing. To the question, what had he been thinking about for so long,
Kholmov replied: 'About how I will win tomorrow as Black against Bronstein ...'
} (36... -- {JOURNALIST. It is perhaps not convenient to interrupt you at such
a crowning moment, but I would, nevertheless, like to know whether extraneous
thoughts ever enter your head during a game? --- CHESS PLAYER. Oh yes! For
instance, I will never forget my game with Grandmaster Vasiukov in one of the
USSR Championships. We reached a very complicated position where I was
intending to sacrifice a knight. The sacrifice was not altogether obvious, and
there were a large number of possible variations, but when I conscientiously
began to work through them, I found, to my horror, that nothing would come of
it. Ideas piled up one after another. I would transport a subtle reply by my
opponent, which worked in one case, to another situation where it would
naturally prove to be quite useless. As a result my head became filled with a
completely chaotic pile of all sorts of moves, and the famous 'tree of
variations', from which the trainers recommend that you cut off the small
branches, in this case spread with unbelievable rapidity. --- Then suddenly,
for some reason, I remembered the classic couplet by Korney Ivanovich
Chukovsky: Oh, what a difficult job it was. --- To drag out of the marsh the
hippopotamus. --- I don't know from what associations this hippopotamus got
onto the chessboard, but although the spectators were convinced that I was
continuing to study the position, I, despite my humanitarian education, was
trying at this time to work out: just how would you drag a hippopotamus out of
a marsh? I remember how jacks figured in my thoughts, as well as levers,
helicopters, and even a rope ladder. --- After lengthy consideration I
admitted defeat as an engineer, and thought spitefully: 'Well, let it drown!'
Suddenly the hippopotamus disappeared, went from the chessboard just as he had
come on - of his own accord! Straight away the position did not appear to be
so complicated. I somehow realised that it was not possible to calculate all
the variations, and that the knight sacrifice was, by its very nature, purely
intuitive. Since it promised an interesting game, I could not refrain from
making it. --- The following day, it was with pleasure that I read in the
paper how Mikhail Tal, after carefully thinking over the position for 40
minutes, made an accurately calculated piece sacrifice. --- To return to the
Championship; the last round game, taking into account the fact that I was
White and that my opponent was the uncompromising Tolush, was bound to be a
fighting game, and that is how it turned out (see the following game).})

begun so well soon brought me grief. My father died, and for several months I
was out of sorts. Even my final state exams were put off until the following
spring. I returned to chess only in the summer, when I played in the World
Students' Championship in Reykjavik. The USSR had a formidable team: two
Grandmasters plus several strong masters, so that there was essentially no
battle for the cup. I played well, and one of my games, that with Kolarov, is
given here. --- Two further team events followed: the Championship of Europe,
and a semi-tourist, semi-serious trip to Italy, which was absolutely
unforgettable. At the 12th Olympiad in Moscow the previous year, the Italian
team had invited us to playa series of friendly matches. I hope that they will
not be offended if I admit that, even at the board (we were, after all, barely
adults), we were thinking of how we would wander around Venice, touch the
stone of the ancient Coliseum, and visit La Scala and St. Peter's Cathedral.
--- Nevertheless, we played assiduously, winning all five matches. One of the
games was rather unusual. Before the start of play my opponent, the master
Sabadosh, a charming, kind man already advanced in years, came up to me and
said that he had to his credit draws with Alekhine, Lasker and Euwe. In my
youthful ignorance, I did not realise that this was a veiled offer of a draw,
and since I had a cold, in reply I asked him to excuse me for the fact that I
would spend as little time as possible at the board, so as to avoid infecting
him. Indeed, I used only 7 minutes on my clock, but this was enough to win the
game. To the credit of Signor Sabadosh he was not offended, and when, being
unable to attend the banquet, I was lying in my hotel room, he sent me wine,
fruit, and, as a souvenir, a fashionable tie of unbelievable colouring. When I
returned home, the doctors established post factum that I had been suffering
from pneumonia.} (42. -- {JOURNALIST. And didn't your new title protect you?
--- CHESS PLAYER. The title was indeed new. During the Championship of Europe
a FIDE Congress was held, and our Federation proposed me for the title of
International Grandmaster. The formal grounds for this were clearly inadequate.
--- In the first place I was not an International Master, and secondly I had
not reached the Grandmaster norm in an international tournament. Against this,
the argument was put forward that I was the USSR Champion, and had won the
title in a very strong tournament. The decision taken by the Congress was
truly Solomon-like: I was 'exchanged' for L. Evans and A. Bisguier, who had
failed to make the norm by something like half a point, and we all three were
raised to the rank of Grandmaster. --- The following year, 1958, found me both
at home, and away: the Championship of the Soviet Union was held in Riga.}) (
42. -- {JOURNALIST. Is it better to play on your home ground or not? --- CHESS
PLAYER. For footballers it is without doubt an advantage. Everything is
familiar, and they have the support of the fans, but in chess it is by no
means certain. --- On the strength of my experience, I can say: it is good to
be 'at home' when one is playing well. If things are not working out so well,
playing at home is more difficult. In addition, the Championship was a Zonal
Tournament, so that I was therefore making my debut in the battle for the
World Title.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Were you planning to repeat your success,
or...? --- CHESS PLAYER. That's it - 'or'. I didn't think especially about
first place, but with the tournament being the Zonal, Koblents and I made
plans for me to finish in the first four so as to go forward to the Interzonal.
}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Do you still set yourself targets, and plan your
results? --- CHESS PLAYER. Only very relatively. Usually I leave this to my
second, or my wife. They suggest to me a schedule, or, more accurately, three:
a maximum programme, a minimum, and a so-called realistic programme. The
maximum is nothing but wins, the minimum is a little over 50% (where defeats
are not intended!), while the realistic programme is somewhere in between. ---
So, it was festival time in Riga. Apart from the usual spectators, my pupils
were also watching the play. I was in my probationary period at school, and
the class to which I taught literature consisted almost entirely of fanatical
chess players.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Is it true that they once played chess
during one o/your lessons? --- CHESS PLAYER. On this occasion you are right.
When I first went into this class, there was a board with the pieces set out
on the window-sill. I decided that this must be a new form of 'boot-licking'
before the teacher, and, casting a professional glance over the board, I saw
that White could give mate in four moves. --- Then I committed a pedagogical
mistake, turning my back on the class for two or three minutes while following
a pupil who I had called up to the blackboard. --- When I turned round again
to face the rest of the class, I saw that the position on the board had
changed, and that White no longer had even an attack, never mind a mate in
four. It was clear that the combatants preferred play to study. Having
established who the players were, I severely demanded that the lads give me
their mark books, which, as it happened, were simply lying on the teacher's
desk. At the end of the lesson I returned them, and said: 'Let's come to and
understanding: chess and studying don't go together!' --- 'Black' silently
took back his mark book, but 'White' asked for my autograph. --- And in his
mark book I had to write: 'Failed to find a mate in four during a literature
lesson'. After this we became friends. --- In the Championship I began with a
game against Tolush. A hum of expectation greeted our appearance on the stage:
our game from the last round of the previous year's Championship was still in
people's minds. On this occasion Tolush was in poor form, and played badly.
But I found, as early as the third round, that the battle promised to be very
difficult for me also. --- Against Boleslavsky in the King's Indian Defence I
employed one of my rare opening innovations, quickly won a pawn, and obtained
good winning chances. --- All I had to do was to make one prophylactic move,
but this seemed fainthearted to me. I immediately occupied an open file with
my rook, and Black's pieces came to life. At some point I considered that it
was too early to offer a draw, but when I actually decided to speak, I saw
that it was already too late.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Your second successive
defeat against Boleslavsky... if someone defeats you. Does this tend to
repeat itself in subsequent games? --- CHESS PLAYER. It is more accurate to
say that this happens after a defeat in the first game. In such cases there is
indeed an unpleasant tradition of things being repeated.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST.
What in general do you think about the problem of revenge? --- CHESS PLAYER.
There is an old Russian proverb: 'The father hit his son, not because he
gambled, but because he tried to win back his losses.' In principle, striving
for revenge - chess revenge! - is a good intention, but when it becomes an end
in itself, and this has often happened to me, then you lose your sense of
reality and of objectivity in assessing a position, and instead of revenge you
have quite the opposite. I have no doubt that this is what explains, for
instance, my catastrophic score against Korchnoi.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. But
in that case, wouldn't it be more sensible to forget the past, and begin each
game with the score at nil-nil? --- CHESS PLAYER. Of course it would, but
emotions arise of their own accord. --- Let us return to the Championship.
Next I won a game against Averbakh, which is given here, and which provoked
great arguments until the theorists showed that my piece sacrifice was
inadequate, and that by an intermediate move White could have kept his
material advantage.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. Just a minute! How was it that you
sacrificed a piece, without special justification, against a Grandmaster? What
were you counting on? --- CHESS PLAYER. The point is that all leading
Grandmasters have a chess 'character', which is well known. Averbakh likes,
and always heads for, positions where the situation is absolutely clear.
Indeed, in our game this psychological trait manifested itself completely. On
the very next move, in an attempt to clarify the situation, Averbakh simply
returned the sacrificed piece. I do not know whether he did this deliberately,
or whether he overlooked something and the game immediately transposed into a
position of a clearly defined type, with Black having an extra pawn.
Objectively speaking, the position could still have perhaps been held, but by
now Averbakh was already in time-trouble, and he overlooked a little tactical
stroke which led to great material losses. The sacrifice would have had no
chance at all against players such as Korchnoi or Kholmov, who readily go in
for sharp complications with the aim of keeping material which has been
sacrificed against them.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. So you wouldn't have taken
such a step against them? --- CHESS PLAYER. At any rate I would have thought
about it longer, since at the board I could not see a direct refutation of the
sacrifice. --- Of the other encounters, I recall very well the one with
Petrosian. I obtained the better position, but it was here that I realised
that I still had much to learn in the way of strategy. The exchange sacrifice
offered by Petrosian was at the same time both the strongest and the only move.
Today, I would have declined it without hesitation, thus keeping the
initiative, but on that occasion I won the exchange, and... adjourned the
game in a critical position. On resumption I slipped out, not without the
assistance of my opponent.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. This was an example of
Petrosian's famous sense of danger. How well is it developed in your case? ---
CHESS PLAYER. Not at all, I'm afraid. I still don't understand how I have been
able to go through certain tournaments without defeat. --- The middle of the
tournament turned out very badly for me. After refusing a draw, I blundered in
the game with that same Korchnoi (there you are, trying for revenge!), and
then this was repeated in my game with Bannik, against whom I had a clean
score up till then. True, in this case there were 'collaborators' in my defeat.
I caught a cold, had a slight temperature, and was given an injection of
antibiotics. --- However, the nurse made a mistake, and gave me a sedative. My
friends noticed that during the game (it took place on the day for
adjournments) I was not my usual self. I didn't walk about at all, but all the
time sat at my table, looking at the board with a melancholy gaze. I also
played very limply. I got into a bad position, then Bannik made a hash of
things. The game became level and I began to wonder whether I shouldn't try to
win. I forgot about everything else, including my clock. It was only the
demonstrator's stare that warned me that I had only a few seconds remaining
and I seized the nearest pawn and pushed it forward, thus compromising my
whole kingside. I lasted as far as the time control, but no further. --- After
this I found that my score was down to 50%, with almost half the tournament
over, and with very little to hope for. --- Perhaps it was this that allowed
me to begin playing easily and calmly. I won several games in a row, and then
Polugaevsky and I played a semi-dramatic, semi-comic game. In the
time-scramble I lost part of my advantage, and in the adjourned position was a
pawn up, but whether this was sufficient to win was not clear. In addition, we
did not consider Polugaevsky's sealed move at all, which was to move his king
towards mine. --- The game continued, and then the moment arrived when I had
to either exchange rooks and straight away agree to a draw, or else for no
reason at all give up two pawns. I was very angry, partly because the previous
day my opponent had offered me a draw in an inferior position, and partly
because I had failed to guess his sealed move; without really thinking, I
chose the second path, whereupon it took desperate efforts on my part to gain
the draw. --- Even so, my fight to reach the top four and the Interzonal was
going well. Towards the finish the pace of the leaders had slowed considerably,
and after a win in the penultimate round, I went ahead together with Petrosian,
with Bronstein half a point, and Averbakh and Spassky a point behind. One of
us had to go! The piquancy of the situation was increased by the fact the last
round pairings were Petrosian-Averbakh, myself against Spassky, and
Bronstein-Korchnoi, so that no-one ventured to predict the results. --- It
turned out that, of the three games, only one was to be decisive. My rivals
quickly agreed draws, whereas Spassky and I were engaged in a battle not for
life, but to the death. Strictly speaking, a draw would have suited me:
firstly, this would have enabled me to share first place, and secondly, I was
playing Black. --- But Spassky had no desire at all for a play-off match with
Averbakh for fourth place. The result was a sharp variation of the
Nimzo-Indian, then at some point Spassky did not play as energetically as was
possible and an equal position was reached. When I offered a draw, he refused.
This was possibly because he had a score of two wins and two draws against me,
but it seemed to me that Boris knew about my carefully-guarded secret - I was
still unwell. --- Be that as it may, but I immediately made a bad move, and
got into difficulties which grew and grew. Somewhere before the time control I
could have gained a draw by going into a rook ending a pawn down, but instead
I chose a heavy-piece ending where my king was in danger. --- We analysed
until five o'clock in the morning. There appeared to be no direct win for
White, but my position was highly unpleasant. Then my second sent me off to
sleep for about three hours: the resumption was in the morning, at nine. ---
My difficulties began while still on the approach to the tournament hall.
Despite the fact that it was a weekday, there was a mass of fans around the
entrance, and it was practically impossible to flight one's way through. My
pupils, who had simply skipped their lessons, were also gathered there. ---
The game was resumed. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Petrosian in a
new suit, white shirt and tie, apparently all ready for his interview as
Champion. --- In the small buffet behind the stage Spassky was feverishly
drinking kefir (Translator's note: A sour milk product, similar to yoghurt.) -
it seemed that he too had only slept a little. --- For the first six moves or
so a forced variation was followed, and then up to a certain point Spassky
played very well; only six months later was it found how he could have won. In
over-the-board play, after a sleepless night, he was unable to solve this
difficult problem. In addition, he was not in the best of moods - in the
penultimate round he had suffered a defeat. --- After we had played about
another fifteen moves there were still only two possible results: either
Spassky would at any moment force a draw, or else he would convert his
advantage into a win. Even so, my position was improving 'inch by inch', and
finally White was faced with a choice: he had to force a draw, or else the
position would become more complicated, and the number of possible results
would be increased to three. --- Spassky did not force a draw, but after a
couple more moves, with both kings now under fire, he offered one in a
somewhat changed voice. To be honest, I was embarrassed. In the first place, I
had always held a certain sympathy for Boris. --- Secondly, I very much wanted
to play in the lightning tournament which was just about to begin. However,
everyone, myself included, had been greatly carried away by the game, and
besides, to agree a draw would have been unethical from the chess point of
view: for the first time in the game I had the chance to play for a win, and
it was just now, and not a minute earlier, that the game would have been
concluded. --- All this flashed through my mind for 30-40 seconds, and then I
declined the offer. --- Immediately I saw how Spassky, who always plays, I
would say, with theatrical calmness, began to get nervous. It became clear
that it was now difficult for him to decide on the correct continuation, and
indeed it was all over within five moves, with my king, which had broken out
of captivity, taking part in the execution of his white colleague.}) (42. -- {
JOURNALIST. I realise that an enemy in life, and an 'enemy' at the board are
different notions, but do any human feelings towards the opponent - respect,
enmity, liking - have an influence on the course of a game? --- CHESS PLAYER.
Naturally! Although sometimes in a strange way. For instance, neither Spassky
nor I have the slightest willingness to play against opponents for whom we
have a feeling of enmity, whereas Botvinnik and Korchnoi try to rouse this
feeling in themselves before a game. --- Strange though it may seem, it was
after our tragic encounter in the Championship that Boris and I became friends.
He put himself in my place, and realised that it was not personal enmity
towards him that caused me to reject his offer of a draw. I think that he
would have done the same, if he had been in my place. --- The result of this
game proved to be a surprise to everyone: to Averbakh, who had been hoping
against hope for a play-off match with Spassky, to Petrosian, to Spassky, and,
for all my optimism, to myself.}) (42. -- {JOURNALIST. And how did the fans
react? --- CHESS PLAYER. They went wild! --- Even so, it is always more
difficult for me to play in Riga than anywhere else. --- What I have in mind
is the Championship of the Republic. If, to the rest of the world, I was
already twice USSR Champion, International Grandmaster and so on, to my
colleagues at home I was still the same Misha. Therefore I could not expect
any special deference at the board, and in the Latvian Championship two months
later I only took third place. In fact, I obtained the highest percentage of
points in all my appearances in the Championship, 16 out of 19, but two others
scored 17! --- The fate of the tournament was decided by an incident which can
only be called an anecdote. Before my game with Gipslis I was preparing for my
University State Exam in Russian. This included Old Church Slavonic, Old
Russian, Dialectology, and God knows what else, and so I was surrounded by
some ten kilos of specialist literature. But suddenly the door bell rang, and
the postman arrived with, besides the rest of the mail, the latest issue of
Shakhmatny Bulletin. I decided that fate itself was calling on me to relax, so
I lay down in a hot bath and began reading the magazine. Straight away I came
across an article by N. Krogius on a topical variation of the Sicilian Defence.
At that time I readily played this line both as White and Black, and here I
suddenly read: 'Recently Black has frequently adopted the new continuation ...e5'. There followed two games, one of which Black won, while the second was
drawn. --- That's excellent, I thought, I'll have a quick draw in this
variation with Gipslis, and then return to Philology. --- As if it had been
pre-arranged, inside 5 minutes we had played the moves of the variation given
in the article, but when I made the 'recommended' move ...e5, a thought
suddenly struck me: but what if White plays simply Bc4? Gipslis, however, did
not give me time to torture myself mentally, but straight away made this move.
--- The game continued for the full five hours, after which I had a hopeless
position, and all that I achieved was an adjournment. --- The following
morning I passed my exam, but resigned the game, whereupon we began analysing
it. The first question that Gipslis asked was: 'Didn't you get the bulletin
then?' --- 'Yes, why shouldn't I have?' --- Here he took the bulletin out of
his briefcase, showed me the move ...e5, then turned over a page (!),
whereupon I read the very first line: 'However, by answering ...e5 with Bc4,
White sets his opponent difficult problems.' --- Since then I have never
prepared for a game while lying in a hot bath. --- However, there was no real
need to feel distressed. Shortly after this I went away to the south on the
insistence of my doctors, who had detected some mystical (as it turned out)
spots in my lungs, and after I had been detained for a couple of weeks in a
sanatorium, Koblents arrived, and we began making unhurried preparations for
the Interzonal Tournament. Then a telegram from our Chess Federation arrived:
'We would very much like you to play in the World Students' Team Championship,
only in the most important matches'. I was really pleased. I was bored with
the resort, and I felt fine, so I flew straight away to Moscow. True, the most
important matches proved to be all ten, and I enjoyed playing them, while for
the right to play the tenth game, Spassky and I drew lots. --- Incidentally,
on this occasion the main burden was borne by the top two boards, and when the
following year Boris and I did not take part, our team dropped back, thus
suggesting that the problem of preparing our young players was problem number
one. A successful solution was found two years later.}) 1-0

{The Three Rooks' Sacrifice: Very often, while delivering lectures, I have to
answer certain questions: 'Could you explain how you prepare yourself for
tournaments?' or similarly 'What is the best way to prepare for important
competitions?' --- I have to say at once that readymade formulae do not exist.
The only possible solution, which must be strictly kept in mind, is that one
should always be conscious of one's individual style and consider future plans
to develop it. --- Twenty years ago Botvinnik proposed his own system to help
developing chess players in their preparation. In his system, great attention
was drawn to two points. Firstly, theoretical preparation: mainly analysis of
specific variations, and secondly, psychological preparation. It is
interesting to note that Botvinnik owned files containing the games of all
possible future opponents. Botvinnik would also give great importance to his
physical preparation for important tournaments. --- Nowadays, with the
considerable improvement in chess standards, this system is somewhat out of
date. For example, it is not quite clear whether it is correct to play
intensively in tournament after tournament. Botvinnik's answer is 'no' and he
also confirms this by not playing too often. On the other hand Grandmaster
Gligoric plays very often and I have to add that, even by doing so, he never
loses his good form. --- One other question: 'When ought one experiment?' It
is no secret that most competitions are aimed at qualification or are held for
some other important competitive reason, and a tournament's narrow frame of
calculation does not allow the chess player to use his full imagination - it
is not easy to play in a style which one would use in a practice game. In this
last sentence we perhaps discover the answer to all our previous questions!?
--- Indeed, when chess players meet in training games, which do not decide
qualification or other achievements, they can try out some of the most
interesting or dangerous variations, and it is up to the opponents to decide
either to disclose the results or to keep them to themselves for a 'fight
night' surprise. --- I would like to draw readers' attention to the following
practice game, which I played with my trainer Koblents.} 1. d4 e6 2. c4 f5 3.

{The reader is no doubt well aware of the significance of this encounter,
which took place in the last round. (Translator's note: Victory would give Tal
clear first place; Spassky needed to win in order to make certain of
qualifying for the Portoroz Interzonal.) In order to reach his respective goal,
each player needed to win; this left its on the course of the game. The
opening was played rather unusually by both sides. --- Spassky and I in turn
offered pawn sacrifices, and then Black offered the exchange, although this
sacrifice also remained 'behind the scenes'. On the 23rd move I considered the
position to be sufficiently simple and level, and I offered a draw. White
decided that he could, without risk, continue the struggle, and perhaps he was
right. In any case, it was I who committed the first mistake, after which
Spassky seized the initiative. He conducted the middle section of the game
superbly and at the adjournment Black's position gave serious call for alarm.
Play was to resume in twelve hours' time. --- One can easily imagine how I
analysed the adjourned position, together with my trainer A. Koblents. At
about five o'clock in the morning the analysis was terminated for 'technical
reasons' (one of the analysts fell asleep). Nevertheless, when I went along to
the resumption, I considered that the game should finish as a draw. That is
how it should have been. For a long time Black maintained the equilibrium,
though it is true that, in order to do this, he had to find a number of
difficult moves. The strength of one of these was evidently underestimated by
Spassky, who, by inertia continued playing for a win in a now level position.
Now the advantage was on Black's side, and his counter-attack became
irresistible.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 ({In preparing for this

attack on the kingside. One only has to recall the wonderful game
Botvinnik-Capablanca (AVRO 1938), where White sacrificed his knight on h5, or

at g7 concluded the struggle.} 11. f3 ({Keres points out that White could have

{The Interzonal Tournament was now approaching; incidentally, this was the
first individual international event in my career. --- The conditions in the
tournament were rather severe. For the first time, the rule came into force
that, from anyone country (read - USSR!) no more than two (at first), and then
no more than three (as was decided after 12 rounds) players could go forward
from the Interzonal to the Candidates Tournament. Therefore, each of the
Soviet quartet was required not only to win, but to come ahead of at least one
of his compatriots. In short, only 1st-3rd places guaranteed success, compared
with 1st-6th places for the remaining contestants. Jumping ahead a little, I
would like to say that on this, my first visit to Yugoslavia, I played well,
and this happy tradition has continued ever since: I frequently visit this
country, which is so hospitable to chess players, and regarding my results in
tournaments and matches (touch wood!) as yet I have no cause for complaint.
Great interest was also roused by the debut in the international arena (as far
as the World Championship is concerned) of the youthful (if one can consider a
mere 15 year-old to be a youth) Robert Fischer. Shortly before the Interzonal
he stopped off in Moscow for the first, and unfortunately as yet the last time,
but there he only played a few lightning games. He was often asked to give
interviews (at that time Robert would still agree to this), and everyone was
startled by the fact that Fischer, answering questions quite freely, said that
on the whole he would have expected to take first place, but that this would
be difficult, since first place could be taken by Bronstein. --- As far as I
am aware, this is the first and last time that Fischer voluntarily put someone
else ahead of himself. However, Fischer had no doubt at all that he would
finish in the first six. --- 'But how will you do this', correspondents asked
him. --- 'Very simply. I reckon that I have to find five opponents against
whom I can win. This means that I will win five games, and draw the rest',
Fischer replied. --- 'And suppose you lose to someone?' --- 'That's nothing to
worry about; then I will have to win six games.'} 1. -- {At first it seemed
that this was nothing more than youthful bravado, since in the early rounds
Fischer played badly. At the start he drew with Neikirch, having had the
inferior position as White as early as the 14th move. Two moves later the
Bulgarian Champion unexpectedly offered a draw. When the journalists asked him
why he had done this, Neikirch replied: 'It was somehow embarrassing to win
against the lad, on my return home to Bulgaria they would laugh at me.' ---
Following this, Fischer won a lost game against the little-known master Fuster
and, within a day or two, in crushing style... lost to Benko. From then on,
amazingly, the young player improved literally with every round. The draw
brought him up against all our players somewhere in the middle of the
tournament. His first opponent was Bronstein, then Averbakh, myself and
Petrosian. All four games were very tense, and our players were by no means
peaceably inclined, but nevertheless all the games were drawn. My encounter
with the American Champion was fairly sharp. A roughly equal position was
reached, but I very much wanted to avoid drawing with this boy, so I played
riskily, after which Fischer gained a dangerous attack. Then he made a mistake,
and with an unexpected move I seized the initiative. At this point Fischer
offered me a draw, but I declined. --- He was in time-trouble, and, with
literally only seconds remaining on his clock, on the 39th move found the only
reply, a very strong one, which enabled him to maintain the equilibrium. The
game was adjourned, but the following day I myself offered a draw, since it
was clear that neither Black nor White could win. --- Before this I had
managed to start the tournament fairly well, but then there followed a highly
annoying defeat at the hands of Hatanovic. In a fashionable variation of the
Sicilian Defence I played very carelessly in the opening, and went to win a
piece, but this turned out to be a variation prepared by my opponent. I am not
especially accustomed to defending, and although I obtained excellent drawing
chances thanks to my opponent's mistakes, I nevertheless lost. Therefore on
the following day I went along to play Filip in the mood 'win or bust'. In a
sharp position I decided on a piece sacrifice, which, if declined, would lead
to a slightly inferior position for Filip, while its acceptance would have
unpredictable consequences. --- It would appear that the sacrifice was not
100% correct, but before making his move and capturing the piece, Filip
offered me a draw. I realised that there was something in the character of the
position that my opponent did not like, so I declined the offer, and in the
subsequent confusion somehow outwitted him. It was at that time that the
following phrase originated, addressed by one of the spectators to my second:
'If Tal has an open file, then there will be a mate!'. Although to be honest,
it should be said that in this particular game there was no great likelihood
of a mate. In the middle of the tournament there came a sort of pause of three
successive draws, and, reckoning that I had no right to such 'peacefulness' 
(although all three games were quite hard fought), in my game with Rossetto I
declined a draw in a position which was perhaps even rather dubious. --- This
affected my opponent, who proceeded to lose in the concluding stage for no
particular reason. Then came a win over Benko, and I established myself in the
leading group. I could be fairly sure of my entry into the Candidates
Tournament.} (1. -- {It was the two final rounds, in which I met in turn the
young Western players Panno and Olafsson, which proved to be decisive as
regards the winner of the tournament. I was leading, since Larsen, angered by
the loss he had suffered at my hands the previous day, had played with great
enthusiasm against my nearest rival Petrosian, and had defeated him. Then came
the ordeal of the last two rounds. The game with Panno gave me enormous
satisfaction, and it was later awarded the prize for the most interesting game
of the tournament (it is given here with notes). However, it was adjourned in
a highly complicated position, and we racked our brains for a long time,
trying to find a way to win. Tired, I decided to have a quick draw with
Olafsson. In my youthful ignorance, I never considered that my opponent might
play for a win. --- Once again I played the opening very light-heartedly,
quickly exchanged several pieces, but failed to make an accurate, very
essential move. I offered a draw immediately after this. Olafsson declined.
Only then did I look more deeply into the position, and realised that my offer
of a draw had been somewhat tactless. In short, my opponent adjourned the game
in a completely won position. The games were to be resumed the following day.
A win against Panno was considerably more doubtful than a defeat against
Olafsson. We put the game against the Argentinean Grandmaster to one side, and
began looking through the possibilities in the quiet, dull rook ending against
the Icelander, every minute becoming more and more convinced that things were
very, very bad. --- In the end we hit upon an idea which at first sight seemed
completely absurd, whereby I simply moved my king away from the enemy passed
pawn, but where we found some ways for my opponent to go wrong. In the
alternative case my opponent would have to demonstrate some elementary
technical knowledge, whereas here I could lose much more quickly, but Olafsson
would also have the chance to make a mistake. --- Koblents and I showed our
analysis to Lev Abramov, the leader of our delegation, and asked him what he,
a chess master, would do in such a case. He unhesitatingly opted for the
second possibility. The game with Panno was the first to be resumed, and it
ended surprisingly easily, since Panno had considered his position to be lost,
and had not analysed it very carefully. After this, employing my not very
great acting talent, I resumed my game against Olafsson, and tried to play as
confidently as possible, especially since Olafsson, as was his habit, had
thought for a long time over his sealed move - 45 minutes - and had relatively
little time left. Of course, in normal circumstances this would have been
sufficient to win, but Olafsson also became nervous. When I led my king away
from his pawn, he sank into thought, and used up a further six minutes. His
first move was correct, his second also, but on the third move he went wrong,
and a drawn position was reached by force. After this the question of first
place was essentially decided.}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Didn't such a meteoric
rise frighten you to some extent? --- CHESS PLAYER. To be honest, I thought
that everything was going quite normally, and besides, I have always been of
the opinion that, of the two evils-under-estimation and over-estimation of
one's own strength - the former is much the more harmful. Almost directly from
Portoroz, we set off to the Olympiad in Munich. Petrosian and I were making
our debuts in the role of reserves, although certain of my friends said that
to some extent this belittled the achievement of twice winning the
Championship of the Soviet Union. However, I was very well aware that
Botvinnik, playing on board one, and Smyslov on board two, and Keres and
Bronstein had given a great deal more to chess than had Tal or Petrosian, and
so, as far as I was concerned, this team order was the only one possible. ---
Besides, I had never played against Botvinnik or Smyslov, I had once come
ahead of Keres by half a point, which does not mean a great deal, while
Bronstein had always been my idol. --- At the Olympiad, Petrosian and I had a
comparatively easy task, since at that time the class of play of our opponents
on the bottom boards was not especially high. We both made a pretty good score.
A couple of games stick in my mind, and especially the one with Trifunovic,
which was very interesting. When, prior to the match, the Yugoslavs were
deciding who to put up against Tal, they chose the 'old fox', as Trifunovic
was called by the Yugoslavs themselves, a highly tenacious player, stubborn in
defence although insufficiently aggressive. --- I played this game with great
enthusiasm, for I realised that to win against Trifunovic was a problem of, so
to speak, increased complexity. In addition, he very much wanted not to lose.
After the game, Trifunovic's colleagues came up and congratulated him on the
draw, since at one time his position had appeared somewhat dubious. He replied:
'Yes, I got a draw, but it wasn't at all easy'. --- Seventeen years later, in
the International Tournament at Las Palmas, I was playing against the Yugoslav
Grandmaster Ljubojevi6, who in 1975 was of roughly the same age as I had been
in 1958! In this game I got into a difficult position, but then after highly
interesting complications it ended in a draw. This time the other players came
up and congratulated me on my good defence, and I quite involuntarily repeated
Trifunovic's phrase: 'Yes, but it wasn't at all easy'.}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST.
Did you think in Munich that you might possibly have to play a match against
Botvinnik? --- CHESS PLAYER. Not really. The Candidates Tournament was due to
take place a year later, and it seemed a long way off, but I gained great
pleasure from watching the play of the World Champion.}) (1. -- {JOURNALIST.
Did you examine it closely? --- CHESS PLAYER. No, no, not specially. Simply
for the first time I was on the same stage where the Champion was playing, and
was present when he was analysing. --- This made a great impression on me,
almost as if I were an amateur. --- 1959 began, as was the tradition at that
time, with the Championship of the Soviet Union. I set off for Tbilisi
'burdened' by having been twice USSR Champion. --- I realised perfectly well
that it was somewhat unusual and 'improper' for one player to win the
Championship twice in a row. I further realised that, on this occasion, the
other contestants, even without themselves suspecting it, would form a sort of
coalition against me, for to become Champion for the third time running would
be simply too much. The effusive Mark Taimanov even stated that if this should
be possible and should happen, he would give up chess. Thus, by not taking
first place at Tbilisi, I performed a good deed for chess... --- I arrived
late in Tbilisi. My first round game, against Taimanov as it happened, was
postponed. My first result in the table was the traditional nought, obtained
in my game with the young player Yukhtman, who played the Scotch Gambit
against me. In striving for more than equality, I at some stage overestimated
my chances, and came under an attack which my opponent conducted very
accurately. --- As I have already said, this type of defeat acts as a spur to
me, and in the next two rounds I defeated Polugaevsky and Geller, in two very
interesting games. --- Then came draws with Keres and Lutikov, and a win
against Krogius, whereupon I had to play Petrosian, who had begun the
tournament highly successfully, and was playing with great verve. Tbilisi was
after all the town where he had been born, and the town where he had grown up;
on his 'home ground' he very much wanted to win. As usual, he did not lose any
games, but he won more often than in, say, the Championship of the previous
year. However, our game was postponed due to his being unwell, and this
somehow affected me, for I realised that the encounter was very important in
the battle for the leaders' jersey. In the following round I received a most
unexpected stroke of fortune. The master Nezhmetdinov, who always played
against me with great relish, once again conducted the whole game splendidly,
and obtained a completely won position, but then made a bad blunder, and lost.
This victory did not give me any particular pleasure, and although I then
defeated Averbakh, I had the feeling that retribution was not far off. I even
appeared on Georgian television and said that I was unaccustomed to the idea
of being the potential leader after the tenth round, and that to be honest, I
was afraid it would not continue for long. --- That is exactly what happened;
retribution came the following day. Exploiting my over-active play, the young
player Gufeld, who had apparently always held me in respect and even a certain
trepidation, on this occasion was in a very aggressive mood. We castled on
opposite sides and I was happy about this until it became apparent that his
attack was developing significantly faster than mine. --- Some five rounds
before the finish, Petrosian and I played off our postponed game, which, like
the majority of the ones we had played previously, ended in a draw. The
decisive role, which ensured that in this Championship I essentially took no
part in the struggle for first place, was played by an episode which occurred
when the adjourned games were played off. --- At that point I had accumulated
three adjournments: against Gurgenidze, Vasiukov and Spassky. In the last I
had a certain, perhaps even decisive, positional advantage in the endgame, but
I fully appreciated that physically it would be simply impossible to analyse
all three positions, especially since in all three a hard fight was in
prospect.}) (1. -- {After finding out from a control colleague in what order I
would have to play off the games, and having made sure that, except in extreme
circumstances, the game with Spassky would be played off last, I considered it
my duty to warn Boris that I would do everything possible to ensure that our
game was not resumed that day. He fully understood my position, and agreed,
especially since he had only one game adjourned. --- We arrived for the
resumption. There was a slight complication in that Vasiukov, whose game with
me was due to be played off second, first had to play Lutikov. --- I sat down
against Gurgenidze, and apologised to my opponent, saying that I was going to
play very unhurriedly, since I did not want our game to end before Vasiukov
finished his game with Lutikov. --- With an unexpected move, which had been
found literally an hour before the resumption, I succeeded in quickly
obtaining a decisive advantage against Gurgenidze. --- I attempted not to
force matters, while maintaining my advantage, especially since in the
adjourned game with Vasiukov my knight was much stronger than his bishop, and
the character of the position was such that my knight could roam all round the
board before I had to undertake decisive action. Thus the possibility of the
game with Spassky being resumed appeared to be ruled out. --- Then Lutikov
reached a position with king, bishop and knight against Vasiukov's lone king.
I thought that their game would be over at any minute, so I forced matters,
and Gurgenidze resigned. But at this point Vasiukov, in his game against
Lutikov, continued calmly and imperturbably seeking the only legal move with
his king. The controllers waited for the customary 15 minutes, and then began
looking for Spassky, but he had taken me at my word, and had not arrived for
the resumption. The control team began discussing the matter. One of the
controllers suggested that the Lutikov-Vasiukov game should be interrupted,
but this would have meant helping Lutikov to find the winning method, although
only formally, since the strong master was well familiar with the technique of
mating with bishop and knight against a lone king, and it was Vasiukov who was
dragging things out. The formal point of view nevertheless prevailed. Spassky
was found somewhere, and we sat down to resume our game. It was not at all
surprising that within some 20 minutes I made a mistake, and now Spassky
gained the advantage. Even so, the game finished in a draw, which gave
Petrosian the chance to consolidate his position as leader. --- My traditional
loss to Korchnoi in the penultimate round allowed Petrosian to practically
assure himself of first place. In the final round all three contenders for the
medals drew their games. The result was gold for Petrosian, and silver for
Spassky and myself. --- Personally, I didn't feel that I could complain about
the result although, for some reason, it was considered by some that a share
of second and third places was practically a failure for me. --- Then I
returned to Riga where, within some four to six weeks, the Latvian Chess
Olympiad took place. The tournament was run on the Swiss System of which I had
the most unhappy memories, since three years previously I had suffered a
failure in such a tournament. In addition, I very much wanted my trainer,
Koblents, to take part in this tournament, since on the whole he appeared in
important events rather rarely. I did everything I could to talk him into it
and I even said that if we had to play each other, and I had White, then I
would offer him a draw in advance. I don't think that it was particularly
because of this, but, be that as it may, Koblents agreed to play. Starved of
tournament chess, he played with great relish, and after five rounds we had
drawn away from the other competitors, and headed the tournament table with
five points each. We naturally met in the sixth round, with Koblents having
White. A familiar situation, wouldn't you agree? Let anyone who has never in
his life acted in this way cast stones upon me, but if the Maestro had offered
me a draw before the game, it would have been instantly accepted. However,
Koblents kept quiet, and the game began in fairly serious fashion. I chose the
French Defence, with which I have never been particularly successful, and
obtained a dubious position, which around move 16-17 became lost, and everyone
realised this. At this point, when it was his turn to move, Koblents offered
me a draw. The position was such that he could himself force perpetual check,
or could slowly and surely convert his advantage into a win, or else he could
apparently win immediately, but here he would fall into a trap.}) (1. -- {I
could not agree to a draw in a lost position, since I have never been disposed
to accepting charity, and I thought to myself: 'If he is really offering me a
draw, then he will give perpetual check'. So I left it up to him to make the
choice. --- Such 'independence' on my part apparently annoyed my old colleague,
and after a few minutes' thought the Maestro very emotionally (outwardly at
any rate) carried out the winning combination. In doing so he fell into the
trap, about which I have already spoken, and soon an endgame, slightly
favourable for me, was reached. A draw could have been agreed, but now it was
I who felt offended: after all, the Maestro had spurned perpetual check. After
the game had been adjourned, contrary to tradition, we sat in opposite corners
of the hall, eating our sandwiches and analysing the same position, but
exchanging light-hearted comments. On resumption I managed to win around move
75. Koblents understood the course of my thoughts, and realised that I had
acted, as it were, according to the highest principles. --- Soon after this a
tournament began which was organised to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the
Zurich Chess Club, one of the oldest in Europe. This was my first individual
international event, not connected with the battle for the World Championship.
I travelled to it with Grandmaster Keres, whose company I have always found
enjoyable and relaxing. Play came easily to me in Zurich, although in the
first round I suffered my 'traditional' defeat, on this occasion at the hands
of the Swiss master Bhend. Keres jokingly reassured me, saying that I had lost
to a player who was practically a compatriot. The point was that not long
before the tournament, at the International Festival for Young People and
Students in Moscow, Bhend had met a Russian girl and had married her. ---
After my initial misfortune, I succeeded in winning four games in a row in
fairly entertaining style, with tactical blows of the sort that so appeal to
fans. Incidentally, it was in Zurich that I first came across a system of
material stimulation for results. The prize-money awarded to the participants
for the number of points gained was unusual: in cash terms, two half-points
were not equivalent to the same point gained by means of a win and a loss. If
the many years have not affected my everyday memory - as yet I cannot complain
about my chess memory! - a draw was 'worth' 25 francs, and a win 60. There was
even a consolation of 10 francs for a defeat. --- I don't think that it was
this that so affected play, but there were very few draws, at any rate quiet
ones. Indeed the draw which everyone had predicted between Keres and Tal only
came after I succeeded in escaping from my opponent's highly unpleasant grip.
--- Then, in the seventh round, came a game which I enjoyed, as did the
spectators, and even, it would seem, my co-author Keller (see the following
game). I will give it without notes, since the variations left behind the
scenes are numerous and complicated.}) *

{In the last round, only a win could satisfy Fischer, but the game ended in a
draw, with, I would say, a moral victory to my opponent, who equalised quickly
as Black. Now only Gligoric could catch me, and for a further twenty moves he
tried to win an ending with rook and bishop against Kupper, who had a rook and
knight. Even so, this game also ended in a draw, and so Gligoric and I
finished up, as in the Interzonal Tournament, with half a point between us.
Fischer shared 3rd and 4th places with Keres, and he began to be talked about
more and more. --- So, everything seemed fine. We returned home to join the
Latvian team, which was preparing somewhere by the sea in Riga for the USSR
Peoples' Spartakiad, when I had my first attack of kidney trouble. The doctors
were unable to say anything definite immediately, but suggested that in any
case I shouldn't play in the Spartakiad. I realised that it would not be easy
for me there on top board against Botvinnik, Spassky, Geller, Keres,
Boleslavsky and others, but I decided that my participation would to some
extent help the team. Although I took last place (for the first time in my
life!) in the team leaders' tournament, scoring 2½ out of 8, I nevertheless
succeeded in saving a few points for our team in analysis, so that the lads
considered that I had been justified in playing. --- I realised, as early as
the preliminary group, that I could not hope for much. I had only just
sacrificed a knight on g7 against Keres, when I had a recurrence of the attack,
and straight away the game ceased to be of interest. The following day exactly
the same happened, and I am still sorry about this game: it could have been
one of my best. Here is the second half of it, Spassky was White.} 23... f6 $1

JOURNALIST. I recall that 10 years ago, you said that you were intending to
play it every time you sat down at the board. --- CHESS PLAYER. Did I? Well,
in principle that's true. Only, nowadays I would say: 'today I may play my
best game', and not 'I must play'. After these encounters I restrained my
appetite for chess, trying to equate my needs with my possibilities.
Nevertheless, I prepared carefully for the first game in my life with
Botvinnik. However, instead of him, the Moscow reserve Vasiukov turned out and,
as a result of this, it was Smyslov who suffered 'on the rebound'. I was
expecting Botvinnik to play the Caro-Kann Defence, and the position which
Smyslov and I were to reach in the second cycle of the coming Candidates
Tournament in Yugoslavia was already standing on a board in one of the rooms
of the skyscraper 'Ukraine' hotel, during the Spartakiad in Moscow. --- In all
the remaining games from the Spartakiad, except one, I quickly agreed a draw,
but I lost to my old 'enemy' Nezhmetdinov at the very moment when, in a
slightly better position, I decided that it was time to win something back.
The rest is understandable. --- After the Spartakiad in Moscow, the usual open
lightning championship of the city took place for the prize donated by the
newspaper Vechernaya Moskva. I already had experience of lightning tournaments
and readily played in them, not unsuccessfully. On this occasion, in the heat
of the battle - and a tournament of five-minute games with 24 participants
lasts for about 6 hours - I had a new attack. --- After losing some ten games,
and dissipating the whole of my plus score, I took a flight to Riga, and
within 2 hours was already in one of the clinics there. --- The next morning
they operated on me, and took out... my appendix. The most amusing thing is
that, for several years after this, my attacks of kidney trouble ceased (!),
and I found out that the first operation had been ineffective only when I had
my diseased kidney removed. --- I was allowed 10 days to recover, not by my
doctors, but by the International Chess Federation: the Candidates Tournament
in Yugoslavia was about to start. --- My friends arranged for my luggage to be
taken to the airport, and then Grandmaster Averbakh (at first he was my only
second; Koblents arrived somewhat later) and I, together with Keres, Petrosian,
Smyslov and their seconds, set off for Bled. --- I was not much troubled by
the effects of the operation, apart from in a purely mechanical sense; during
a game I did not feel inclined to stroll about, and I was unable to walk
quickly. I was able to devote myself to the battle, and in round one the first
game of my life against Smyslov was adjourned in a position that I considered
drawn, despite the fact that I was the exchange down. Then I won against
Gligoric, and after this I played Keres, not even suspecting that the result
of this meeting could be of great significance. Who thought that it was the
future winners who were playing? --- In this encounter I at first succeeded in
outwitting my formidable opponent in tactical complications, but then,
rejecting the simple in favour of the complex, I first of all gave up my
advantage, and then lost the game.}) 1-0

{Taking into account the loss of my adjourned game against Smyslov, my
tournament position - one point out of three - was not very prepossessing,
especially since my failure against Keres had been rather annoying. --- Our
game had apparently so exhausted Keres that the following day he played
passively and lost against Petrosian, who thus became the leader. As White
against me, Petrosian did not force matters, and after defeating the remaining
foreign contestants, I finished the first cycle amongst the leaders. --- The
second cycle went roughly the same way, except that, in addition, I succeeded
in winning a game against Smyslov that was important for my frame of mind. As
you will recall, it was here that exploded the mine intended for Botvinnik in
the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad. However, the attack itself, and the sacrifices
in this game - which won the brilliancy prize - were pure improvisation. ---
The game provoked a great deal of interest (it is given here), and every
morning for at least three weeks the leader of our delegation, Grandmaster
Ragozin, would exchange variations with the well-known Yugoslav journalist,
master Vukovic. --- Vukovic would come up with a refutation of the combination,
and Ragozin, the next day, would respond with an improvement for the attack.
In the end they came to the conclusion that White had sufficient pressure for
the piece. --- Such play so appealed to me, that I decided: everything is
possible! A couple of days later, in my game with Keres I suddenly saw a
fantastic possibility of sacrificing two pieces: a knight on b6, and a bishop
on d6. I carried out the plan, ran up against a simple refutation, and
continued to resist, prompted only by emotion, since I could have resigned

{However, my optimism remained high, since I considered that I had been
unfairly punished for an original idea. After a further three wins in a row,
it was clear after the end of the second cycle that if nothing extraordinary
happened then either Keres or I would be the winner. The tournament moved on
to Zagreb, but before this, a lightning event was held in Bled. I succeeded in
winning it, but what sticks in my mind is something else: a unique oversight.
I cannot recall the exact position, but the mechanism of the blunder was as
follows: It was Black to move. Averbakh offered me a draw, but I decided to
play on. I saw that I had to defend against the threat of 2 Bxh7+ and 3 Qxd5.
So I defended by} 1... h6 $4 {. As you will have guessed, Averbakh replied} 2.
Bh7+ {, and didn't offer a draw again. --- I will jump ahead a little. During
the Candidates Tournament, two further lightning events were held. I took
first place in both of them - in one, after a playoff match with Matulovic.
Before the play-off Matulovic demanded that we should share the prize,
irrespective of the result. I did not object, although the prize that the
organizers had put forward was a single air-rifle. In addition. it was not of
the double-barrelled variety. --- I began the third cycle sharing 2nd-3rd
places with Petrosian, but it was already clear that Tigran was fading a
little. As usual, he underestimated his chances, and was clearly happy to
fight for a place not higher than an honourable third. --- From this cycle I
must again recall in particular the games with Smyslov and Keres (the
encounter with Fischer is given here). In the first of these my opponent was
obviously intent on gaining his revenge for the game from the second cycle,
and besides, it was clear that the players from the older generation who were
fighting for the crown did not especially want to allow a young upstart into
their midst. --- Up to a certain point Smyslov played the game brilliantly and
completely outplayed me, while in addition I had only 2-3 minutes left for
some 15 moves. I had nothing to lose, there was no time for hesitation, and I
attempted only to complicate my opponent's task in any way possible. Then,
with my flag horizontal, and a further four moves still to make, Smyslov ran
into almost the only 'swindle' I had managed to think up. As I later found out,
he had seen my rook sacrifice on g1, but not on h1. --- Smyslov is normally
imperturbable at the board, but here, after my 39th move ...Rh1+, his face
changed, and after thinking for some three minutes, he made his reply and
slammed his clock with furious force. Some of the pieces fell over, but,
contrary to my normal practice, I first gave check with my rook on g1, pressed
my clock, and only then began to restore order on the board. White could no
longer escape from perpetual check. --- On the same day, Keres blundered in
his game with Fischer, and I drew level with Paul Petrovich, and then after
the next round, when I won against Gligoric, I went into the lead for the
first time. --- The next game, with Keres, thus took on an even greater
significance. Before going in for some forced complications my opponent
offered me a draw. I recalled the two games I had already lost to him in the
tournament, and besides, I was-playing Black, and was leading him by half a
point. Thus a draw was desirable on all accounts, except one: the position was
highly interesting and I did not want to part with it. --- The subsequent play
was very lively, and although I got into time-trouble (by the way, when I am
in form, I even now do not worry about the consequences of time-trouble), I
managed to win.} *

{JOURNALIST. In the majority of cases you decline when you are offered a draw.
Do you take time to consider the suggestion, or, like a charger, do you
straight away 'snort' defiance at the sound of the bugle? --- CHESS PLAYER.
Alas, that is normally what happens. I will even let you into a small 'trade
secret'. When I am offered a draw around move 15, while the position is still
'flavourless', and there is no real fight going on, then I am more inclined to
agree, but later I more often decline. --- So, the third cycle went highly
successfully for me: a part from the draw with Smyslov I shared the point only
with Petrosian, and won the rest of my games. I am now prepared to admit that
in the 3rd and 4th cycles Petrosian and I did not really play. This was a
negative reaction to the practically unanimous comments in the press after our
game from the second cycle. We had played seriously but then read the
following opinion, which was not exactly complimentary to us: 'Of course, Tal
and Petrosian are friends; there is nothing one can do about it, all their
games finish in a draw'. This angered us, and we decided: 'Right, we'll show
them how to really draw without a fight!' Over our next game we spent a total
of 5 minutes, not more. --- I set off for the fourth cycle in Belgrade with a
lead of 1½ points. Taking into account the fact that in my two most
important games, with Smyslov and Keres, I had White, I assumed that this lead
should suffice. --- However, I am unable to win a tournament without any
adventures. They began with the game against Smyslov, where I needlessly threw
myself into the attack, ran up against an excellent defence, then
half-blundered, half-sacrificed a piece, and only in the time-scramble managed
to win after a blunder by my opponent on the 40th move. --- In the following
round Smyslov was this time 'on my side', and defeated Keres, and since I won
against Gligoric, I was leading by 2½ points with five rounds to go. I had
only to draw with my closest pursuer Keres, who at that moment was already
resigned to taking second place, and victory was in the bag. I realized this
perfectly well, but as White nevertheless decided to attempt, if possible, to
make the score in our individual match 2-2. Here I found out, for the first
time in my life, that to play simultaneously for two results (no one plays
deliberately for a loss, as far as I am aware) is not possible. I began with
the intention of playing a complicated positional five-hour game, but then a
couple of times I had a certain change of heart, and Keres very keenly sensed
this indecision on my part. From around move 15, he himself began playing for
a win. From inertia I avoided exchanges on a couple of moves, and when I made
up my mind to play only for a draw, it proved to be too late. This win gained
Keres the prize for the 'Best Game'. --- Two rounds later, the distance
between us had narrowed to one point, and in the penultimate round I had to
play the quite revitalised Fischer, who up till then had capitulated in all
our three games. Afterwards I was told that Bobby had sworn in public to at
least exact his revenge at the finish, so as to have the last word. --- In
preparing for the game we decided that I should play the normal Sicilian
Defence with ...d6 and ...a6, and as regards the sacrifice of White's e-pawn,
we carelessly waved our hands and said 'Oh, take it!' So I took it, although I
was unprepared, subsequently made a couple of mistakes, and felt myself to be
on the very, very edge of the abyss. Especially since Fischer was playing very
keenly and accurately, while Keres, 'scenting blood', had as Black set himself
to do everything he could to crush Gligoric. In short, everything pointed to
the fact that the question of first place would be decided in the last round,
or even after it. --- However Fischer, not wishing to remain a pawn down for
long, hastened to re-establish material equality, and in doing so lost a part
of his advantage. On the 18th move I was faced with a choice: I could either
go into a slightly inferior ending, or else I could accept a piece sacrifice,
thereby subjecting myself to a very strong attack. I could not see a forced
mate, it is true, but perhaps only because I wasn't looking for one. If I had
been playing White, I would have considered the attack to be decisive. ---
Nevertheless, I chose the second path, and within three moves the following
famous position was reached. --- It is famous, because it was here that a
widely-known psychological duel took place between us. --- Every player has
his own habit: one will first make his move and then write it down, while
another will do wings the other way round. Incidentally, in recent years
Fischer has actively objected to this 'other way round', expressing the
opinion that a scoresheet is not a black-board for writing down exercises.} 22.
-- ({However, in our game Fischer first wrote down the move} 22. Rae1 $1 {,
without doubt the strongest, and wrote it not in his usual English notation
but in European, almost Russian! Then he not very deftly pushed the scoresheet
towards me. 'He's asking for an endorsement', I thought to myself, but how was
I to react? To frown was impossible, if I smiled he would suspect 'trickery',
and so I did the natural thing. I got up and began to calmly walk up and down
the stage. I met Petrosian, made some joke to him, and he replied. The
15-year-old Fischer, who was essentially still only a large child, sat with a
confused expression on his face, looking first at the front row of the
spectators where his second was sitting, and then at me.}) ({Then he wrote
down another move:} 22. Qc6+ $2 {, and after} Rd7 23. Rae1+ Be7 24. Rxf7 Kxf7
25. Qe6+ Kf8 $1 26. Qxd7 Qd6 {, I held on to my extra piece and adjourned the
game in a won position. When I later asked Fischer why he hadn't played 22
Rae1, he replied: 'Well, you laughed when I wrote it down!'}) (22. -- {After
this, my second made me give my word to offer a draw in the last round on move
12. At that time my score against Benko was 5-0, and the idea that he might
refuse the draw somehow never occurred to me.}) (22. -- {JOURNALIST.
Especially after the performance with the glasses? --- CHESS PLAYER. Yes, of
course! In the third cycle, when we sat down at the board Benko, who had
earlier suspected me of hypnotising him, took out of his pocket a pair of dark
glasses and put them on. This 'innovation', like any that the opponent knows
about beforehand, was met by a 'counter-stroke'. I had borrowed some enormous
dark glasses from Petrosian, and following Benko I straight away put them on.
Not only the spectators laughed, as well as the other participants and the
controllers, but also Benko himself. Unlike me, however, he did not remove his
glasses until as late as the twentieth move, by which time his position was
already hopeless. --- So in the last round, after playing g4 on my 12th move,
I kept my word and offered a draw. Benko silently made an answering move, very
quickly blundered, and got into a lost position. On the 21st move I could
either give perpetual check, or else go into a completely won ending with two
extra pawns. --- I gave perpetual check, and with the quick temper of youth
explained my decision to the journalists as follows: 'When I want to win
against Benko, I win; when I want to draw - I draw'. Today I can only request
indulgence, taking into account the fact that I was then only 22 years old,
but I should say that from the psychological point of view it would have been
easier for Benko if I had won that game... --- Only after this, on the
initiative of the journalists, did I begin thinking about the match with
Botvinnik. --- Before the match there was one more tournament: the first
International Tournament in Riga, held under the slogan 'The Baltic is the sea
of friendship'.}) (22. -- {JOURNALIST. But was it sensible for you to play in
it? After all, there was less than six months to go before the match. ---
CHESS PLAYER. In the first place, it would have been rather awkward for me to
decline to take part in Riga. Secondly, Koblents and I decided that I should
try to 'cover up' in the opening, especially as Black against 1 d4. In
addition, Koblents set me a purely 'academic' task: to play somewhat passively
in the opening, so as to become accustomed to defending. --- This was the
general aim. We did not set a goal as far as the result was concerned, and it
is doubtful whether this would have helped, for the winners, Spassky and
Mikenas, played very, very well. A certain consolation was provided by the
prize for the best attack in the tournament (this game with Johannessen is
given here) and my result in the traditional lightning tournament: 16½ out
of 17. --- Of course, I am only joking. Seriously speaking we were happy with
the creative results of the tournament as one of the steps in our preparations
for the match. --- I spent the last few days of the year in Vilnius, and I
could not decline an invitation from our Lithuanian neighbours to give a
simultaneous display, where I was confronted by almost entirely first category
players. The display concluded with an honourable result for me: +19 -1 =6.
--- Then the year 1960 arrived, but before leading the conversation on to the
two matches for the World Championship, in which I happened to be a
participant, I should like to tell you about an episode from the distant past.
It is about how M. Tal was sent out of the class. --- Autumn 1945: A singing
lesson for the 5th year of the 77th Riga school. Behind one of the desks, two
boys are intently turning over the pages of the chess bulletin 14th USSR
Championship (this was my first encounter with chess literature). --- The
'studying' proceeded according to the principle: the less comprehensible, the
better, since symbols such as e4, Nf5 etc. were at that time like some kind of
hieroglyphics to me. However, one thing was perfectly clear: there was a
string of 'ones' against the name of Botvinnik. Carried away by what we were
doing, we made perhaps the first blunder of our chess careers: we 'overlooked'
a question by the teacher. The retribution was swift and severe. --- All my
generation -lads who had first learned chess in the immediate post-war years -
had their idol. He was, of course, Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik. Many were
supporters of Keres, many wished Smyslov success, but they, and others,
admired the first Soviet World Champion. --- In 1948 I also achieved some
success in the field of chess - I reached fourth category rating. It is very
possible that I played a little worse then than I do now, but my
self-importance was no less. When, in May, Botvinnik was proclaimed World
Champion, I was truly delighted, and yet somewhere inside of me there was a
slight doubt: how could this be, after all he had never played me?! --- Years
passed. Schoolboys became students, fourth category players become candidate
masters, but the idol remained the same. I must repeat that until the last
round of the 1959 Candidates Tournament, the idea that I would at some time be
playing a match for the World Championship with Botvinnik never entered my
head. Now the moment had arrived.}) *

{In making judgements about chess, many people are in the habit of taking into
account only tournament or match-play where the players sit opposite one
another and endeavour to gain a victory in their combat within five hours.
However, a tournament encounter is only one of a variety of chess art-forms.
Analysis of opening variations, chess compositions, correspondence chess, and
many other elements must be considered when we talk about the art of chess as
a single unit. --- I have permitted myself this introduction in order to
emphasise the thoughts that overtook me at the beginning of last year. The
well-known Stockholm newspaper 'Dagens Nyheter' invited me to play a game by
telegraph with the Swedish Grandmaster Stoltz. --- If I had declined this
invitation I would have lost the joy of taking part in a game against a player
with an interesting, sharp, combinative style (let me remind the reader that
the Swedish grandmaster has won many beauty prizes for tournament games). I
would also have missed trying out my powers in a thoroughly strange field.
Correspondence chess is different from other chess forms in certain
characteristic respects. A player is not handicapped by the same time-control 
(although in correspondence chess there is occasionally a time forfeit in fact,
through the fault of the postal service) and he can calmly analyse the
developing position in domestic surroundings undisturbed by the 'Sword of
Damocles' on the chess clock. --- In order to give as true as possible a
picture of the contest, I have used telegrams received from Stockholm and a
diary written on the specified day. --- 22nd March: A telegram received from
Stockholm with the suggestion of playing this game. Simultaneously a newspaper
proposed that the opponents choose their opening variation to make the game as
interesting as possible. What should I choose? After a little thought I
decided on one of the sharpest Sicilian Defence variations. And so the duel of
the correspondence game has begun.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6

the pawn on a2, because he would be in danger of losing the knight. Should

1. d4 Nf6 {Despite his youth the American Champion is very conservative in his
choice of the openings. Playing with White he plays only O. Bender's
recognised move e4, and with Black he operates only with the Sicilian or
King's Indian systems. Preparation against an opponent like this is not
difficult. However, it is interesting to note that Fischer has prepared this
narrow repertoire very well. Many chess players were surprised when after the
game Fischer quietly explained: 'I had already analysed this possibility' - in
a position which I thought was not possible to foresee from the opening. For
this game I borrowed the Petrosian system: on the surface very peaceful, but
with a large 'dose of poison'. The opening was played very quickly. --- Note:
Tal is alluding to a well known Russian chess story. Ostap Bender, an
extremely weak chess player, arrived in the small town of Vasyuki and
announced that he would give a lecture followed by a simultaneous exhibition
at the Cardboard-Workers' Club. By describing himself as a Grandmaster, Bender
persuaded many townsfolk to pay to watch or to participate in his exhibition.
On each of the thirty boards he opened 1 e4 and each game ended in his defeat.
At the end of the 'exhibition', Bender rushed out into the street and escaped
in a waiting boat.} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 {An innocent move,

Knowing the United States Champion to be a player with chess principles (not
to say dogmas), I had no doubt that one of the variations of the King's Indian
Defence would be played in our game from the third cycle. It will not be out
of place to recall that the majority of Fischer's defeats in the Candidates
Tournament were the result of him repeating the same, and to a considerable
extent, inferior opening systems. Of course, one cannot place an opening such
as the King's Indian Defence in such a category, but from the results of this
tournament it can be concluded that Grandmaster Petrosian, possibly without
himself realising it, has placed King's Indian players in a very difficult
position. If I remember correctly, he first adopted this system in his game
with Suetin from the 25th USSR Championship, when he spoke very modestly about
its value, saying that its main advantage was that Black did not obtain active
play. Many games have now been played with this system. Black indeed does not
obtain active play, but White does, and what play!} h6 9. Bh4 a6 ({The

the author of the system, Petrosian, in his game with Gligoric from the final
round. --- In the present game Fischer chooses the most dogmatic, but also
very slow, continuation, involving the exchange of the dark-squared bishops.
This continuation, I recall, was recommended by Grandmaster Averbakh in an
article devoted to the tournament in Portoroz, and one must suppose, for this
reason, that it was familiar to me. After the game it was revealed that the
