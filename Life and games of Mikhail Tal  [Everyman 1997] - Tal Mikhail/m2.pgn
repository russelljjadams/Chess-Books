{Soon after my return from Yugoslavia, I met Botvinnik in the Grandmaster room
of the Central Chess Club, and we began 'discussing' the conditions for the
match. I have put the word in inverted commas, because at that time, although
I had behind me some experience of match play (against Saigin in 1954), I
nevertheless did not expect that it would all be taken so seriously. There was
in fact no discussion between us, and indeed, there could not be; I fully
relied on Botvinnik's experience, and the majority of the details of our
meeting have slipped my memory. I recall just one point: the World Champion
persistently argued the necessity for having two envelopes when a game was
adjourned, so that the loss of one (and such a thing can happen even in a
World Championship Match) would not be so serious. --- Two envelopes - that
means two scoresheets, on each of which one has to write down a secret move 
(preferably the same one on each sheet), and since at that time (and even now)
I could not cope with carbon paper, the whole procedure of the sealed move
seemed to me to be made doubly crucial (perhaps because of this, in our first
match I had only to fill in the envelopes - it was always Botvinnik who sealed)
. --- It is both pleasant and complicated to recall the 1960 match. Why it is
pleasant, the reader will, of course, realise perfectly well; the difficulty
lies in the fact that all that I can say concerning it has evidently been
written in my book on the match. Nowadays I sometimes turn over the pages of
this book, and try to establish to what extent it was written by a youthful
hand (to express it somewhat delicately). At any rate, my next book about a
match for the World Championship will be more 'adult'. --- I have to admit to
the reader that my frame of mind prior to the first game was not particularly
optimistic; there was good reason for this. The fact was that in the preceding
years I had developed the 'nice' habit of beginning a tournament with a loss.
The 25th USSR Championship, the International Tournament in Zurich, the USSR
Peoples' Spartakiad, and finally the Candidates Tournament - I think that this
list is quite sufficient. Besides, this had become so ingrained in me, that
the result of the first game did not come as a surprise either to me, to my
opponent, who turned up for the game to receive his 'due' point, or to my
friends, who began listening to chess reports and buying bulletins only after
the second round.} 1. -- {One of my friends (I don't know whether he was being
serious) suggested that I should simply not turn up for the start of the match,
but should join in at the second game. Who knows, I might have followed his
advice had it not been for an old story which accidentally impressed itself on
my mind. It is well known that in train crashes it is the rear coaches that
come off worst. At a meeting where the question of eliminating the cause of
such calamities was being discussed, a wise old signal operator suggested:
let's just uncouple the last coach, and let the train go without it. As you
can see, these two solutions are almost equally profound... --- No doubt
because of this, we arrived in Moscow on time. If there had been some
discussion as to whether to begin the first game at all, how to begin it we
knew beforehand. At the conclusion of the Candidates Tournament in Belgrade, a
Yugoslav radio commentator had asked me: 'What will you play on the first move
of your first game with Botvinnik?, I then promised to begin by moving my
e-pawn, and, of course, I did not want to break my word for no special reason;
besides, the move 1 e4 is not bad in itself. --- The match began very well for
me. Koblents and I had guessed which opening variation the World Champion
would choose, and although Botvinnik had prepared an innovation, I was well
familiar with the character of the position. I won after a short, sharp
skirmish. After the seventh game my lead had increased to three points, but
the chess content of our games in no way corresponded to the results. --- The
positional advantage gained by Botvinnik as a result of deep, well-thought-out
play, was in many cases beyond dispute, and only time-trouble errors, and, to
a greater extent, excessive caution in time-trouble, told on the result. ---
Sensing this disparity, I played the eighth game, I would say, excessively
recklessly: if I was going to be punished it would serve me right, while if
chess injustice was to triumph once again - well, as compensation I would have
one more point.} *

{At first the eighth game developed along familiar lines. By move 15 Botvinnik
had a positional advantage, by move 20 an extra pawn, and by move 25 both the
one and the other. However, by move 30 the position had become significantly
sharper. After a further few inaccurate moves on White's part, the following
position was reached: Amazed by his good fortune, Black confidently made what
he thought was the winning move} 34... Rbc8 {. There was no time to be amazed

spent a few minutes convincing ourselves that further analysis of the

point I was in a reasonable mood: one could quote various proverbs appropriate
to the incident, such as: 'One must reap where one has sown' etc. Then we
reached the position given in the diagram, and almost immediately various
unrepeatable words were uttered. We had both noticed that, by continuing 34...Rec8 instead of 34...Rbc8, Black would have won instantly. It is hardly worth
mentioning the fact that I never closed my eyes that night. Forgotten were all
the 'presents' received earlier; my heart was tortured by the thought of this
scandalous injustice. Early next morning there was a knock at my door, and my
second came in. It was clear that he too had not slept well. Smiling, he
extracted from his briefcase some fresh tomatoes and a cucumber. We
breakfasted, phoned a few friends, and went for a walk around Moscow. Then I
dropped in for a moment to the chess club, made sure that Botvinnik had sealed
41 Nf7+, and in the evening we went to the theatre. (For a long time I was
reluctant to talk about this incident, although I am sure that it demonstrates
very clearly the mastery of Koblents as a trainer.)}) *

{The following game, the ninth, was Botvinnik's best achievement in the match.
In his preparations he had succeeded in rendering harmless an apparently very
dangerous piece sacrifice, and at the board he exploited my positional errors
with meticulous accuracy. The middle third of the match was extremely hard
fought, and its result (+ 1 -1 =6) fully reflects the character of the
struggle. Here fatigue was beginning to have its effect (grandmaster draws in
the 13th and 14th games), while a change of opening from 1 e4 brought me
success in the 11th game. During this time the two perhaps most interesting
drawn games were played (the 10th and 12th). --- Despite the difference of two
points after the 16th game, it was not at all easy to predict the result of
the match. It was without doubt the seventeenth game which proved decisive,
for once again I 'sowed', and should have 'reaped', but a fatal blunder by
Botvinnik in time-trouble led to the World Champion's defeat. By winning the
19th, which is my favourite game from the match, I succeeded in increasing my
lead to 4 points.} 1. c4 f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d4 d6 6. Nc3 e6

{JOURNALIST. This is the game that you like the most, but which move do you
remember best of all from this, the most important match of your life? ---
CHESS PLAYER. I think the 12th move of the seventeenth game, which I have
already mentioned.} 12. f4 $6 {'Horrible', 'anti-positional', 'unbelievable'
etc., etc. - this is how all the commentators, without exception, described
this last move by White. One might think that the player with White was
completely unfamiliar with any elementary book on chess, where it is written
in black and white that one really can't make a move such as 12 f4, since it
weakens the dark squares, leaves the bishop at g5 out of play, and puts in
jeopardy the already compromised position of the white king. I don't think
that the reader will consider me immodest, if I say that all these
considerations concerned me during the game. Nevertheless, the fact remains:
the horrible move 12 f4 was made. Why? I will now try to briefly explain the
course of my thoughts during the eight minutes that I spent over my 12th move.
I first of all established that White has no trace of an opening advantage.} ({
Nevertheless, by} 12. Qd2 {White could have steered the ship towards the
drawing haven, which would probably not have been far off. Although it may
sound silly, during such an important game I suddenly began to be bothered by
the question: 'Will my wife and I manage to get to the cinema or theatre?'}) ({
In fact White has little choice in this position: his bishop is attacked and
any retreat by it is inconsistent; the exchange on f6 is devoid of any
positional sense, defending the bishop by Qc1 is very passive, and the move} 
12. f4 {is simply bad. Thus it is the drawbacks to all the possible moves
which are most apparent. Finally my wandering gaze settled on the move 12 f4.
At first I became somehow embarrassed, for the drawbacks to this move are more
obvious than to any other one, although in the given position there is no move
without its drawbacks. Less apparent are the advantages of this move, but they
do exist, although not in a purely chess sense. In the first place, the move
'demands a refutation' which should be accompanied by the possibility of a
double-edged, tactical struggle, and this, to judge by Botvinnik's style in
the match, would be undesirable for him. Secondly, the weakening of White's
position can only be exploited by an undermining of the centre, and after
moves such as ...c5 or ...e5 the power of the white bishops will be
significantly increased. Finally, Black can attack White's kingside only by
castling queenside, but then White can set in motion his queenside pawn mass.
Perhaps Black should simply have replied} O-O {, but this is after all not a
refutation.}) *

{JOURNALIST. And Botvinnik's best move? --- CHESS PLAYER. Probably the 23rd
move in his best game, the ninth. --- The apparently modest move} 23... Rf8 $3
{enabled Black to carry out the manoeuvre ...Ng4 and...Ndf6, after which it
became clear that the black piece was stronger than the three white pawns.
However, I have already mentioned this earlier. I will add that Botvinnik went
on to win on the 58th move. --- Shortly after the match there was an
interesting friendly match in Hamburg between the USSR and West Germany. At
that time I was an object of enhanced interest to the press, but to be honest,
this had never particularly bothered me, and I soon became accustomed to it.
And the match was also significant for the fact that, for the first time, I
officially began to smoke. --- I made my first contact with cigarettes during
the Candidates Tournament. As you will recall, I made a poor start and for a
short time I became depressed and my post-operation stitches began to pull
unpleasantly. Here, one of the journalists, after making a professional
assessment of my condition, offered me a cigarette. I tried one, it worked,
and I even liked it. I took to smoking in my room, and since I finished in
first place I did not think about the harmful effects of tobacco. At home I
systematically began to 'borrow' the odd couple of cigarettes from my uncle.
During the match with Botvinnik I was already smoking openly, but for some
reason not during the game - I didn't feel I wanted to. On the way to Hamburg
I warned my fellow smokers Geller and Tolush that if I should show any
weakness during play and ask them for a cigarette, they should refuse to give
me one. --- Then came the first game, against Lehmann. Round about move five
he put his hand into his pocket, brought out a cigar, and began puffing away
at it. I held out for another ten moves, but then the board began to rock
slightly in front of me. 'In search of counterplay' I turned to Geller and
Tolush, but they simply spread their hands: 'Misha, you yourself asked us not
to give you any'. --- I dashed into the bar and bought a packet of untipped
'Camel'. Since there is a saying that you are not a smoker if you smoke other
people's cigarettes, but only if you smoke your own, it was in Hamburg that I
became a smoker. --- In general I was happy with the way the match went. The
spectators followed me intently, and, encouraged by their interest, I had but
one draw in eight games.} (23... -- {JOURNALIST. By the way, how in general
are famous players affected by their surroundings? --- CHESS PLAYER. Here
everything depends on the individual. Fischer, for instance, is abnormally
sensitive to the slightest noise in the hall, but it is very difficult to sit
watching in the hall without stirring, and without exchanging opinions with
your neighbour. I myself am sometimes a spectator, and I know that it is so.
Therefore I understand perfectly well how Fischer, Botvinnik, and many others
players find it very difficult to force themselves to concentrate fully, one
hundred per cent, under such conditions. --- Then there are other players,
among them Spassky, Korchnoi and myself. For us it is simply boring to play in
an empty hall. When we appear on the stage, we are artistes. The only
difference is that chess has its own specific form. You yourself are the
composer of the 'song', you are the singer, and you are the critic, and a very
harsh critic, because you wish without fail to refute the ideas and plans of
your 'fellow composer'. --- When we are playing and there is a hum in the hall,
some of us are annoyed, justifiably so, for it is indeed somewhat distracting.
With me it is just the opposite, provided only that I am in good form. When
things are not working out for me I also get annoyed. I am probably a little
jealous if the spectators react noisily to a move made on a neighbouring board
or by my opponent, and not by me. Then I notice that there is a noise in the
hall. When I am in good form, it is not a noise, but a reaction from the hall.
Something altogether different! --- The remainder of the year, from September
onwards, was spent resting, during which time I worked on my book about the
match with Botvinnik. --- During the Olympiad in Leipzig there was also a
happy event: my son was born. --- At the Olympiad my play was, on the whole,
successful. The game with Fischer is given here, and I gained the impression
that it was only after this encounter that he began to 'respect' me.}) (23...
-- {JOURNALIST. How did it happen that it was in this Olympiad that you were
second in the tournament on your board, and failed to win it? --- CHESS PLAYER.
Indeed, it was Robatsch who won, playing in the second final group. I deprived
myself of first place in the final round. This is how it happened. The
Olympiad ended on the day before my birthday and I wanted to be free at the
finish. Therefore I agreed with my fellow team members to play through the
'middlegame' of the Olympiad without a break. However, the day before the last
round, for strictly private reasons, the captain of our team asked me to play.
I 'threatened' him that I would lose, and I carried out my threat, although
God knows, I didn't want to. It was just that the English master Penrose
played the whole game very well. --- It turned out that the Olympiad did not
conclude my chess year. When I returned to Riga it was suddenly suggested that
I should playa radio match with the strongest young players from
Czechoslovakia. At first I readily agreed, but later I regretted this somewhat
- after all, to play on 20 boards against present-day Grandmasters such as
Hort, Jansa and their colleagues demanded time, and preparations had to be
made for the return match with Botvinnik. After travelling to Prague to
conclude the radio match, I ceased to regret it, this time for good: the trip
proved to be most pleasurable and entertaining. Besides, it was not without
its amusing little misunderstandings, caused by the fact that our intermediary,
a correspondent of Czech radio in Moscow, had only a very sketchy knowledge of
chess. Thus, for instance, in one of the games, after 1 e4 e5, I sent the move
2 Nf3, and in reply received the suggestion that I take it back. If I were to
insist on it, my youthful opponent courteously warned me, then on 2 f3(???) he
would play 2...Bc5. --- Nevertheless, I think that the two sides were about
equally satisfied with the score of + 11 =9. --- Then came a small New Year
Tournament in Stockholm, one of the steps in my preparations for the match.}) (
23... -- {JOURNALIST. Botvinnik considered this appearance of yours to be
unnecessary and ill-advised. --- CHESS PLAYER. On that basis, the same could
have been said about the tournament in Riga before our first match. The point
is, most probably, that the winner is not criticised whereas the loser is
always wrong. True, Koblents and I never considered ourselves to be
specialists in the art of preparation. --- The Stockholm tournament was not
one of my most difficult, although its short length made it all the more
important not to lose. The game against Unzicker is given here, and the
analysis of my adjourned game with Book was of interest (see the following
game).}) *

which, it is true, came after the finish of the tournament, was a recurrence
of kidney colic in Moscow, just before the flight to Prague. At first it was
bearable but I returned from Prague under medical supervision after lying
there in hospital for several days. From Prague they even sent their medical
diagnosis to Moscow, whereupon our Chess Federation began considering the
question of deferring the match. I was asked to send a letter to the President
of FIDE with preliminary evidence from a doctor commissioned by my opponent.
To me this all seemed to be very complicated and rather insulting, and I
preferred to play. Besides, my participation in the first match had itself
given me enormous satisfaction, and I was even waiting impatiently for the
second encounter. --- When I meet chess fans, I often have to answer a
ticklish question: what do you think of return matches? As it happened, the
honour of 'closing this page of FIDE' fell to my lot. What would it have cost
the International Chess Federation to take the decision to abolish return
matches a year earlier?! --- I had no doubt that Botvinnik would utilise his
right to a return match. There was also no justification for doubting that he
would be excellently prepared, especially after his splendid performance at
the Olympiad in Leipzig. Not long before the start of this, we once again met
in Moscow to discuss the conditions for the match. On this occasion there was
indeed a discussion - I had after all become more intractable by a year. In
particular, the question of where the return match was to be held was heatedly
discussed. In Riga they very much wanted to see, if not the whole event, then
at least half of it. One of the points in the regulations announced by FIDE 
(in 1960; subsequently I somehow never came across them again) was that the
match should take place in the World Champion's home country. --- Botvinnik,
on the other hand, expressed the following point of view: the return match
should, as far as possible, be an exact copy of the first match, though of
course it was not essential that the result should be the same. Since we were
unable to come to an agreement, we decided to ask the opinion of the FIDE
President F. Rogard. Unfortunately, I arrived a few days late in Leipzig (not
long before this, the car in which I was travelling to the Crimea skidded into
a ditch, and a wheel and two ribs were damaged), and during this period Mr
Rogard had had time to listen to my opponent, agree with him, and depart. ---
So once again it was Moscow in the spring. The controllers were our charming
old friends Stahlberg and Golombek, while Euwe also arrived for the start. The
draw was held in the 'National' hotel, and on the following day the first game
was played, with Botvinnik White. --- The character of the first game showed
that my opponent was in every way excellently prepared for the match. From the
opening Black obtained a very good game. Despite the early exchange of queens,
the position reached was of a clearly middlegame character, but the then World
Champion decided to play solidly. Gradually the position became level, then it
was Botvinnik who obtained a slight advantage. Not anticipating such a turn of
events, Black played the ending uncertainly, and although the game was
adjourned there was no need for a resumption. By my win in the second game I
succeeded in levelling the score for the last time in the match. In the
Caro-Kann Defence Botvinnik introduced a very important innovation, which
neutralised the very system which, during our preparations, we had decided to
make our main weapon against 1...c6. For a long time Black had a good position,
but in the time-scramble I managed to 'outwit' my opponent and, after a
sleepless night with Koblents, I won the game on resumption. Here,
incidentally, for the first time I sealed a move (for the return match the two
envelopes had been abolished). Beginning with the third game, Botvinnik took
the lead. In the fourth and fifth games I managed to extricate myself, the
sixth was a quiet draw (evidently the only one in the whole match), and then
in the seventh came a further telling blow.}) 0-1

was characteristic was the following: prior to the return match I had never
before adopted this system, and it could have been expected to have some
surprise value, since in our preparations the possibility of the Samisch
Variation had been taken into account. However, White's tenth and eleventh
moves (undoubtedly planned beforehand by Botvinnik) showed that my opponent
had studied not only everything that had already occurred, but also everything
that might occur.} 1-0

Nd7+ {I appeared to be coming into form, and at a 'council of war' the
decision was taken to attempt, in the next few games, to change the course of
the match in complications. Alas, this hope was not destined to be fulfilled.
It began when I caught a bad cold, and was forced to take two consecutive rest
days. There was a great temptation to use the whole limit, but in the end I
decided to save one rest day, just in case. This was perhaps a mistake.
Literally straight from hospital I attempted to play aggressively, and for
this I was essentially unprepared. Botvinnik easily parried Black's attack,
and soon achieved both a positional and a material advantage. Black's one
achievement in this game was to make it last for 73 moves. --- Events
developed similarly in the following game. My fully viable 'reserve' variation
against the Caro-Kann (3 e5 Bf5 4 h4) was thoroughly spoiled by my poor 9th
and 10th moves. Botvinnik quickly obtained the better ending, and all my
tactical tricks proved fruitless. --- In the eleventh game came the opposite
extreme. It is difficult to explain by anything but demoralisation my decision
to play the Slav Defence, for almost the first time in my life, almost
imploring my opponent to exchange on d5, and, with a lead of three points, let
me off with a draw. Botvinnik fulfilled the first part of this programme, but
for some reason he considered his lead to be insufficient, and he adopted a
continuation for White which he had prepared some 15 years before our game.
Black was unable to find the correct rejoinder, and soon after the opening the
game transposed into an ending highly favourable for White. --- Today I
realise that a difference of four points essentially signifies the end of a
match. At that time I did not realise this, and I battled on with, I would say,
considerable optimism, which was reflected to a certain extent in the
statistics of the match. Things were apparently alright with my 'forwards' - I
managed to win five games (six in 1960) - but my defence... the ten defeats
tell the whole story. In some games I would allow Botvinnik to slip out, in
others he would do the same to me, but my opponent approached closer and
closer to the 12½ point mark. On losing in the eighteenth game, after which
the score became 11½-5½, I was already prepared in the following game to
congratulate Botvinnik on his overall victory. It was just at that time that
my old friend, International Master (now Grandmaster) Padevsky arrived in
Moscow from Bulgaria, having already prepared an article on the return match 
(more accurately, the title of the article was: 'The king is dead, long live
the king!'). We went to the nineteenth game together, and outside the Estrada
theatre came across a large number of vehicles: the Newsreel and Central
Television organisations had sent their correspondents along to cover the
anticipated coronation. It was evidently this circumstance that thoroughly
aroused me, and I played the 19th game as though to spite the press (see the
following game).} 1-0

pleasant was the fact that, in this game, our analysis of the adjourned
position proved to be more accurate than that from Botvinnik's celebrated
laboratory. --- Once again some illusory hopes appeared. In his article
'Analysis or improvisation', written soon after the match, Botvinnik said that
he had been very tired, and that if the 20th game had turned out unfavourably
for him, it was not clear how the match would have ended. This is, of course,
an exaggeration, but in any event the 20th proved to be a record game, both in
the number of moves (120!), and in the number of man-days. It was twice
adjourned, and twice resumed. At first the game was adjourned in a position
where I knew there was a win, but we were unable to find the most accurate
plan. On the resumption, after only 4 moves, Botvinnik played a line which we
had not foreseen. The game began to look drawish, but then it was Black who
made a mistake. After 88 moves the game was once again adjourned. The
preceding games, played in a continuously tense atmosphere, had evidently
exhausted both players. At any rate, on returning to the hotel after the first
resumption, I simply did not have the strength to continue analysing. The game
appeared to be won, but during the next two days we were unable to discover
anything new. Perhaps therefore, when I once again took my place on the stage,
I failed to notice the expressive faces of the stage attendants, who had heard
from Botvinnik that his position was hopeless, nor did I pay any attention to
the absence of my opponent's traditional thermos, and even failed to take into
account the distressed shaking of his head. --- By finding a clever idea based
on a stalemating possibility, Botvinnik succeeded in saving the game. This
finally settled matters. --- There has been a great deal written about the
result of the return match. Of course, I do not consider that I played better
in this match than at any time in my life, but I can assure the reader that my
preparations for the second match were no less, and in no way inferior, to
those for the first match. Meanwhile, so many reasons have been found to
explain the fall after my ascent, that I myself would like to try my hand in
this field of journalistic solidarity, as it were.} (75... Kc1 {I have managed
to find two reasons: the reader can judge for himself how serious they are: (1)
During the 1960 match, Botvinnik and I lived in adjacent rooms in the 'Moscow'
hotel. Before games, my second would make his protégé happy by singing
Neapolitan songs. This inspired me, but in all probability demoralised
Botvinnik. During the return match Botvinnik did not stay in the 'Moscow'
hotel. --- (2) By the eighth game of the return match I finally succeeded in
selecting a 'lucky' pencil. Alas, after winning, I left it on the table. When,
a week later, I returned, the pencil had gone (perhaps an unknown supporter of
Mikhail Moiseyevich had taken it). I did not manage to find an adequate
replacement. --- This is all, as they say, 'journalism'. Seriously speaking, I
was quite unprepared for the change which had taken place in Botvinnik. He
arrived for the 1961 match extremely self-disciplined and aggressive, readily
going in for a stormy position if it looked favourable for him, which he had
not done in 1960. In the main one must look to the form of the winner to find
an explanation for the result of the match. --- In conclusion, I should remark
that the defeat did not provoke a crisis in my game, although I have read this
on a number of occasions. Three months later I succeeded in taking first place
in a strong tournament. --- This was the tournament in Bled, but before this I
made my debut as Ex-World Champion in the European Team Championship at
Oberhausen. Of the chess events I should mention the game with Toran given
here, and the last time (for the moment!) that I adopted the French Defence,
against Portisch, which led to the score between us becoming 1-1. --- But now
about Bled, the 'Tournament of the Century', as it was called at the time.
Once again the familiar town, the same hotel, though a different tournament
hall which had only just been built. The majority of the competitors were
Grandmasters. --- I was evidently still very conservative, for my first result
to appear in the table was a nought. After adjourning my first game against
Ivkov, I then went down without a fight against Fischer. About once a year I
used to write down one move, and then make a different one, and on this
occasion, as a result of such a transposition, I had a difficult position as
early as the 6th(!!) move, and by the 10th or 12th a lost one. --- In this
tournament I realised that the two matches with Botvinnik had not been
altogether to no purpose, since along with sharp games I succeeded in winning
several by purely strategic means, 'à la Botvinnik'. The most important of
these was the encounter in the last round with Najdorf. At this point I was
leading Fischer by only half a point.}) 0-1

{JOURNALIST. One question in passing. When everything is going well for you,
and then suddenly the tournament situation becomes critical, how does this
affect you? --- CHESS PLAYER. It becomes more interesting and I even begin to
get nervous, which is also good. During a tournament a player has no right to
be a mummy, but the nervousness must come from inspiration and not from a
shaking of the knees. --- It was especially interesting on this occasion, for
Fischer, who was my rival, demonstratively took Najdorf aside to prepare him
for our game. It was quite clear: Najdorf was being initiated into the secrets
of an interesting variation of the Sicilian Defence, which Fischer
systematically and successfully later adopted as Black. --- On the evening
before the game, the Soviet Grandmasters were with Gligoric in the hotel bar,
when Fischer came up to the table and confidentially informed me: 'You will
lose tomorrow to Najdorf. But on the whole you haven't played badly, and I
have no objection to sharing first place with you, so I won't win against
Ivkov.' --- I did my best to dissuade Robert, but he stuck to his opinion. The
following day I played a completely different variation against Najdorf.

part of the deal: he played nearly 20 moves more against Ivkov, literally
until there were only the kings left, but did not manage to win. --- On the
return journey, Keres and I had to 'jump out' of the plane, which stopped off
at Kiev on the flight from Belgrade to Moscow. There we ran to catch the
Kiev-Riga flight, and the following day were already at the board in the
semifinal of the USSR team tournament. Although there were only three rounds
of the tournament remaining, for me it was still the start! And so, inevitably
giving in to the mysterious force, I straight away lost to the candidate
master Barstatis... --- This was followed by a quick draw with my
flight-companion Keres, and then I managed to celebrate my son's first
birthday with a victory over Averbakh (see the following game).} 1-0

final, which pleased us all. But before this final took place, the fate of the
individual USSR Championship gold medal was to be decided. --- This
Championship went so badly for me, that during it I was even reminded of my
tournament position in the quarter-final at Vilnius. Perhaps this was because,
in my game at the start with Bagirov, a kind of psychological change took
place in my conscious mind. My opponent was in severe time-trouble. I had a
winning position, and I saw a sharp but convincing enough way to win. Just
here the thought entered my head that, in our second match, Botvinnik had many
times ignored my time-trouble, and had played somehow exaggeratedly calmly. So
I set my king off on an unnecessary journey, whereupon my astonished opponent
gave several instant checks, reducing his time deficit with every move. My
king crossed half the board before I realised that in the place he was heading
for he would be mated. There was no way back, and Bagirov forced perpetual
check. --- Although only half a point had been lost, which over a distance of
21 rounds is almost insignificant, the 'favourable wind' had also died down.
As a result, in the subsequent rounds, there followed one draw after another,
including some that were pretty annoying.} 1-0

{Here in order to carry out my intended combination, I had to lure the white

active position. I thought for a very long time, trying to choose between the
moves 16...Rd7 and 16...Rd6. I finally decided that the first of these would
too 'crudely' urge White to play Bh3, and settled for the latter. --- Later I

1. e4 e6 {Was this a surprise? In my opinion, no. At any event, when we were
preparing for the match, my trainer Alexander Koblents and I had considered
the adoption of the French Defence to be a very real possibility. Although in
his second match with Smyslov (1957) this opening did not prove particularly
successful for Botvinnik, the fact that he adhered so exceptionally to his
creative principles gave every reason for thinking that he would not give up
further tests of the French Defence, which had brought him so many glorious
victories. The last 'French' game of theoretical significance was played
between Gligoric and Petrosian in the Candidates Tournament (1959), and
brought success in the opening to White. It stands to reason that we had
studied this game, and were not averse to a repetition of the opening moves.
Since it was also obvious that Botvinnik too had examined this game, in the
opening of our very first encounter there began an unusual psychological duel.
Before my second move I thought for a minute, remembering the numerous
branches of this opening, and trying to guess which one my opponent had
decided to choose.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {The French Defence is one of the most
complicated openings. For a long time the opening was thought to lead to a
complicated manoeuvring game without any immediate clashes, but by the efforts
of Soviet theorists, in particular Rauzer (for White) and Botvinnik (for Black)
, ways were found of greatly sharpening the position. --- In the variation
adopted by Botvinnik in this game, Black parts with his dark-squared bishop,
which weakens his kingside to a significant degree. As enduring compensation
for this he gains pressure on White's somewhat compromised queenside. Many
games begun with this opening have shown that, if White does not succeed in
quickly taking the initiative, the weaknesses in his position will tell sooner
or later. For this reason White players now aim to force events, in order to
hinder the consolidation of the opponent's forces.} 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ {
Botvinnik chooses his approved continuation.} ({It is interesting to note that,

be assumed that Botvinnik considered this variation to be perfectly acceptable

in a game with Unzicker at the Amsterdam Olympiad, 1954. However, on this
occasion he did not 'squander' his kingside pawns, preferring after} 7. Qg4 {
the more cautious} Kf8 {, but in this game too he gained an indifferent
position from the opening. --- It was evidently because of 7 Qg4 that
Botvinnik gave up 5..Ba5, although even here the last word has certainly not
been said. From this point of view, the game Matanovic-Mititelu (Zonal
Tournament, Budapest 1960) is of great interest. It should be mentioned,
incidentally, that in recent times the move Qg4 has become something of a
'visiting card' for White in the French Defence, in cases where he is striving
for the maximum from the opening.})) 6. bxc3 Qc7 {This move also has an
interesting history.} (6... Ne7 {looks more flexible, since the king's knight
has to be developed on this square, whereas in some cases the black queen can
occupy a5, and later a4. With the thematic 7 Qg4 White again provokes
complications, on which chess theory has not yet given a final evaluation. If
my memory does not betray me, the last time Botvinnik played 6...Ne7 was in
his game with Alexander (USSR-Great Britain Radio Match, 1947). The English
master continued} 7. Qg4 cxd4 8. Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 Qa5 10. Rb1 {and after a

succeeded in repelling the attack with accurate defence and even in winning
the game, but even so there are few players to whom the resulting position
appeals, since White acquires an appreciable positional plus: his dark-squared
bishop, which for the moment is operating only on one diagonal, can make its
way via d2 to b4, where it will be much more actively placed. --- 'The last of
the Mohicans' trying to uphold this variation with Black is now a gifted young
player from East Germany - Reinhardt Fuchs. He has twice employed this
continuation against Soviet players - with Spassky in the Student World
Championship in Varna (1958) and with Vasiukov (Gotha 1957), but both times he
was crushed in about 25 moves.}) 9. Qxg7 ({In the 14th game of his match with
Botvinnik (1957), Smyslov avoided the complications by playing} 9. Bd2 {. In
this case Black developed his forces as in the above-mentioned game with
Reshevsky, and gained a good position thanks to the passive placing of White's
queen's bishop. I am convinced that, if White wants to gain an opening
advantage, he should on no account reject this type of double-edged
continuation, which is always the most critical and usually the strongest.})
9... Rg8 10. Qxh7 cxd4 11. Kd1 $5 ({Twenty years ago a chess commentator would
have been horrified by such a move. At the very start of the game the white
king voluntarily embarks on a journey. Now, however, few are surprised by this
eccentric continuation. For the moment White prefers to camouflage his plans
for the development of his king's knight, retaining the option of it going
either to e2 or to f3, and he also leaves clear the f1-a6 diagonal. For the
moment the loss of the right to castle is not important since, firstly, the
opponent's pieces are insufficiently developed, and secondly, at e8 the black
king too is not very comfortable. --- As far as I recall, the only game in
which} 11. Kd1 {(recommended by Euwe, incidentally) has been tested was the
above-mentioned Gligoric-Petrosian game. The Soviet grandmaster continued with
the straightforward} Nbc6 12. Nf3 Nxe5 {, and after the very strong move} 13.

Botvinnik's keen analytical searching.}) 11... Bd7 {A very cunning move, by
which Black hopes to exploit the offensive power of the queen at c7, in order
to emphasise the vulnerable position of the white king. The pieces have to be
developed in any case, but first it is best to bring out the bishop.} ({If,
after} 11... Bd7 {, White plays} 12. Nf3 {, then after} Ba4 13. Bd3 Qxc3 {his
position immediately becomes critical.}) ({In the event of} 11... Bd7 12. Ne2 {
Black can again continue} Ba4 {, with the unpleasant threat of 13...d3. It is
apparent, therefore, that the move 11...Bd7 simultaneously pursues two aims: a
strategic one - the completion of development and queenside castling, and a
tactical one - a blow against c2. If White does not want to come under a
strong attack, he must play very actively. There is a basis for this. With 7...f5 Black has rid himself of his f7-pawn, the guarding of which is an
unpleasant role often undertaken by the king itself, but on the other hand he
has weakened the h5-e8 diagonal, which exposes the king and deprives any black
pieces that end up on this diagonal of 'material' support. In addition, the
white queen can now return home with gain of tempo.}) 12. Qh5+ Ng6 ({If} 12...

{Although it had given me a one-point advantage, the start of the match had
not completely satisfied me. In the last four games my opponent had been able
to direct the play along his favourite channels and had invariably held the
initiative. To expect that I would be able to continue gaining draws after
prolonged defence would have been highly frivolous. Therefore we decided at
all costs to change the character of the play. Once again the already tiresome
question was on the agenda: which opening to play? Both the Nimzo-Indian
Defence and the Modern Benoni had in general not produced the desired effect.
There remained one more double-edged opening - the classical King's Indian
Defence, and it was this that we chose. A definite role in this was played by
the fact that against the King's Indian Botvinnik usually chooses a rather
old-fashioned continuation with the fianchetto of the king's bishop, which, in
my opinion, does not give White any opening advantage, and avoids the
fashionable lines (the Samisch and Petrosian Variations) which are considered
White's most dangerous weapons. The very first moves confirmed the correctness
of our assumption.} 1. c4 {This, along with 1 d4, is Botvinnik's favourite
move. The aim of it, in particular, is to avoid undesirable opening lines,
such as the Nimzo-Indian Defence, for example.} ({Thus after} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3
e6 {White can, say, continue} 3. Nf3 {, delaying d2-d4.}) ({In the event of} 1.
c4 e5 {a Sicilian Defence arises with colours reversed, where the extra tempo
naturally plays an important role.}) ({By maintaining the symmetry with} 1. c4
c5 {Black can take play into the English Opening, but it is well known that
Botvinnik plays it in masterly style with both White and Black. After a little
thought, Black decided to make a move that leaves the question open.}) 1... Nf6
2. Nf3 {To some extent White declares his intentions. He emphasises that he
does not intend to play the Nimzo-Indian Defence, nor in the King's Indian
Defence to play the sharp Samisch Variation, in which, as is known, a basic
element of White's play is the propping-up of his centre by f2-f3.} ({At the
same time Botvinnik avoids a variation that was popular in the recent past - a
branch of the English Opening which was still possible after} 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3
Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Nge2 {. White follows up with d2-d3 and then,
depending on which black pawn takes part in the battle for the centre - ...c5
or ...e5 - he begins attacking it either in the first case by a2-a3 and b2-b4,
or in the second case by f2-f4. However, experience has shown that Black's
control of d4 gives him a quite comfortable position, and in particular
Smyslov scored a very logical win in the first game of his match with
Botvinnik in 1957. Botvinnik tried this variation again with White against
Gurgenidze in the 2nd USSR Spartakiad (1959), but in this case too Black
gained satisfactory play from the opening. Now, however, this variation is
not possible, since White has developed his king's knight at f3.}) 2... g6 {
The King's Indian Defence has an interesting history. It received wide
recognition some twenty years ago. Before that the opening was only employed
from time to time and, so to speak, spontaneously. In particular, such a
set-up was chosen long ago by Chigorin, but White's superiority in the centre,
the apparent passivity of the bishop at g7, running up against its own pawn at
e5, and Black's cramped position did not inspire much confidence. In the late
1930s a group of Ukrainian players led by Konstantinopolsky, Boleslavsky and
Bronstein set about making a detailed study of this rejected opening, and gave
it a second wind. Which chess enthusiast is not familiar with David
Bronstein's virtuoso combinations in his games against Pachman and Zita 
(Moscow v. Prague match, 1946), in which the 'inactive' bishop at g7 carried
out its destructive work? For this, it is true, Black sacrificed 'only' a rook.
Which chess enthusiast has not been enraptured by the brilliant ideas of the
King's Indian devotees' 'younger brother', the Odessa grandmaster Yefim Geller,
in whose hands this opening has become a formidable weapon? --- New systems of
development for Black appeared, and the move ...e7-e5 ceased to be obligatory;
in many games Black attacked the centre with ...c7-c5, or sometimes altogether
avoided moving his c- and e-pawns, preferring piece pressure on the centre
with ...Nc6 and ..Bg4. The idea of immediate counterplay on the queenside with
...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5 also appeared. As a rule, Black was able to carry out
all these ideas most successfully with the white king's bishop at g2, and so
players of the King's Indian for White also began employing other set-ups.
They revived the Sämisch Variation, which usually leads to a very sharp battle
with castling on opposite sides, where White tries to demonstrate that the
move ...g7-g6 significantly weakens Black's kingside. Initially this variation
brought White some success, but by the efforts of faithful King's Indian
players (in particular Geller and Gligoric) sufficiently effective antidotes
were found. Grandmaster Tigran Petrosian in turn suggested a very dangerous
idea, involving the development of the bishop at g5 (from where it hinders
Black's counterplay on the kingside), followed by the advance of the white
pawns on the opposite wing, with the aim of opening lines. For the moment the
last word for Black in this variation belongs to the talented Ukrainian master
Leonid Stein, who played ...h7-h6 before Bg5 and thereby nipped White's idea
in the bud, true, at the cost of a tempo. All the same, recent events have
shown that the fashion for the King's Indian Defence has begun to pass, and
even such devotees as Petrosian, Bronstein and Geller have frequently chosen
other set-ups. Perhaps this has happened because its novelty has faded,
perhaps because White's play has become more purposeful, but in any case it is
far too early to write off the King's Indian Defence, since, even if does give
White a slight advantage, Black achieves just as viable a position as in any
other opening.} 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. d4 {White gradually determines his
pawn configuration.} ({Here or a couple of moves later he still had the
possibility of playing} 5. d3 {, giving the game a closed character. It must
be assumed that Botvinnik did not want to define the play so sharply, since in
this variation White gains the initiative on the queenside, but Black gains a
counterattack on the kingside. My opponent probably did not want to allow such
a possibility right from the opening, especially since several recent games,
the most memorable of them being Pirc-Boleslavsky (USSR v. Yugoslavia,
Leningrad 1957), have confirmed its effectiveness.}) ({After} 5. d4 {Black has
to decide which variation to choose. He can switch to the Grünfeld Defence with
} d5 {, but I have only played it very rarely and feel insufficiently at home
in these positions.} ({The attempt to switch to a symmetrical set-up with} 5...
c6 {followed by ...d7-d5 leads to a dull game with a slight advantage for
White.})) 5... d6 6. Nc3 Nbd7 {Another committal move. Black demonstrates his
intention to play the King's Indian in its 'original' form. This was the
variation used when it began being played in important tournaments.} ({In many
games I have preferred the set-ups with} 6... c5) ({and} 6... Nc6 {. The
continuation chosen here has occurred much more rarely in my games, and we
assumed that Botvinnik would be correspondingly less prepared for it.}) 7. O-O
e5 8. e4 c6 {The most flexible. Black does not object to the closing of the
centre, since in this case his knight obtains a comfortable post at c5 and, in
addition, with the centre closed his hands are freed for play on the kingside
- his knight moves from f6 to e8 or h5, making way for the f-pawn. The
immediate capture on d4 promises a definite advantage for White, who gains
more freedom in the centre and on the kingside.} 9. h3 ({In many games
Botvinnik tried to demonstrate that this move, defending the bishop at e3
against attack, is a waste of time, and he preferred the immediate} 9. Be3 {,
but in the 14th game of the Botvinnik-Smyslov match (1954) Black found a
convincing reply to this move-order. He played} Ng4 10. Bg5 Qb6 $1 11. h3 exd4
$1 12. Na4 Qa6 13. hxg4 b5 14. Nxd4 bxa4 15. Nxc6 Qxc6 16. e5 Qxc4 17. Bxa8
Nxe5 {and in a sharp battle Smyslov gained the advantage.}) ({The prophylactic
move} 9. h3 {is after all necessary. White's plans include the harmonious
development of his pieces in the region of the centre, and if sooner or later
he should succeed in forcing the opponent to exchange on d4, he will gain the
opportunity to exert pressure on the weak d6-pawn.} {Black has usually based
his counterplay on the long-range bishop at g7, but with careful play White is
able to neutralise it. Such a course has occurred many times in games where
Black has exchanged immediately on d4,} exd4 ({or continued} 9... a5 {and ...Re8. Black's difficulties in this variation prompted him to begin searching
for more active continuations, one of which (incidentally, also of Ukrainian
origin) is the text-move.}) ({During recent years} 9... Qa5 {, with similar
ideas, has also become popular, but since I had already employed this move in
tournament games, I did not want to repeat it in the match.})) 9... Qb6 {Black
immediately begins action against d4.} ({After} 9... Qb6 {he is threatening a
familiar combination, namely} 10. -- exd4 11. Nxd4 Nxe4 $1 {.}) ({And after} 
9... Qb6 {, at the same time he sets his 'sights' on the c4-pawn (} 10. -- Qb4
{).}) ({Thus if White wants to maintain the tension in the centre, he has to
reckon with numerous counter-ideas by Black. It should not be forgotten that
in some cases (after an eventual ...Ng4) the queen at b6 can create threats to
the f2-pawn. Our choice of opening proved psychologically successful.
Botvinnik again avoids double-edged tactical continuations, and prefers the
immediate closing of the centre, hoping to gain time by attacking the queen.
The other way of relieving the tension in the centre after} 9... Qb6 {,} 10.
dxe5 {, gives White little - Black obtains a comfortable outpost at d4, and
the queen can return to its usual position at e7 via b4.}) 10. d5 cxd5 11. cxd5
Nc5 {The first virtue of the plan selected by Black is evident: his knight has
occupied an active position and is already attacking a pawn.} 12. Ne1 {During
the game I assumed that this was a theoretical innovation.} ({More common here
is} 12. Re1) ({or} 12. Nd2 {, in order to transfer the knight to c4 with gain
of tempo. In this case, however, Black retains freedom of action and can
initiate play both on the queenside by preparing ...b7-b5 and ...Ba6, and on
the kingside by advancing ...f7-f5.}) ({Later, however, I learned that} 12. Ne1
{had been played by Petrosian in a game with Shiyanovsky in a USSR
Championship Semi-final (Kiev 1957) which he won quickly (true, the virtues of
the move 12 Ne1 were nothing to do with this). --- White does not intend to
tolerate for long the 'annoying' knight at c5 and prepares to exchange it. The
role of the piece that will gain a tempo is assigned to the bishop at c1.
Nevertheless, 12 Ne1 has the drawback that White loses a certain amount of
time and the opponent is able to complete his development unhindered. This is
precisely what Shiyanovsky forgot to do in the above-mentioned game, deciding
instead to try and conclude matters immediately with an attack on the kingside.
}) 12... Bd7 13. Nd3 {Botvinnik is of the opinion that frequent appearances in
tournaments are not so essential. Of course, the methods of working during a
preparation period are a matter of taste for every player. At the same time,
modern chess has now reached such a high level that knowledge and ability
alone are insufficient. Every game demands an enormous output of nervous
energy, and therefore regular (more or less frequent) participation in
competitions is necessary for a player to keep in form. The text-move, or,
more precisely, the time spent on it, demonstrate that Botvinnik had not
played competitive chess for a long time. On the quite obvious and undoubtedly
strongest continuation of the manoeuvre begun with the previous move, did he
really have to spend ten minutes out of his overall budget of two and a half
hours? How many times has a player lacked precisely these ten minutes at a
decisive moment!} Nxd3 14. Qxd3 Rfc8 {The critical position. Here Black spent
a long time deciding which plan to adopt in the middle game. He wanted to play
...f7-f5, which gains in strength with the pawns at h3 and g3, since White's
kingside is to some extent weakened.} ({However, the straight forward} 14...
Nh5 {does not achieve its aim in view of} 15. Be3 Qd8 16. Qe2 $1 {, and now
after} f5 17. exf5 {Black has to reconcile himself to a positionally difficult
game after} Bxf5 {.}) ({I did not want to prepare ...f7-f5 by 14...Ne8, as I
was afraid that the queenside would be inadequately defended. Nevertheless, a
more detailed analysis shows that this continuation deserved serious
consideration. After} 14... Ne8 15. Be3 Qd8 {for the moment White cannot
create any real threats on the queenside, and ...f7-f5 can be played without
hindrance. Whether this continuation gives anything real after, for example,}
16. Rac1 f5 17. exf5 gxf5 18. f4 {- that is another question. All the same,
the bishop at g7 comes actively into the game. Black (also partly on
psychological grounds) decided for the moment to play on the queenside, and
then, having dulled the opponent's vigilance, to advance ...f7-f5 at a
convenient moment. I have to admit that at this point I was already seized
with the idea of the knight sacrifice at f4, which, however, was still very
hazy. Black moved to c8 with his king's rook, firstly, to keep his a7-pawn
defended, and secondly, to show White that he was not even thinking about the
kingside.}) 15. Rb1 {A highly revealing manoeuvre. White takes the opponent at
his word, and also concentrates on queenside play.} ({He intends Be3, but with
this aim the immediate} 15. Qe2 {was also possible, which at the same time
would have prevented ...Nh5 followed by ...f7-f5. The position of the rook at
b1 will later give Black a very important tempo.}) 15... Nh5 {Now the opponent
can also be disturbed on the other wing. It transpires that, for the advance
of the f-pawn, the support of the rook is not after all so necessary.} 16. Be3
Qb4 ({Naturally,} 16... Qd8 {would not have been in the spirit of the position,
since in this case the switching of the king's rook to c8 would have lost its
point. White could have played} 17. Nb5 {, forcing a favourable exchange. For
the moment Black adheres to the plan already mentioned - obvious play on the
queenside and latent play on the kingside.}) 17. Qe2 {The threat of ...f7-f5
has become unpleasant, because the white f-pawn is tied to the defence of the
g3-pawn, and in addition, after the opening of the diagonal for his bishop,
Black's pieces on the queenside would be very appropriately placed. It becomes
evident that 15 Rb1 was inaccurate - White has lost an important tempo.} Rc4 ({
The line} 17... f5 18. exf5 Bxf5 19. Rbc1 {, conceding the e4-square, would
have been positionally unjustified. Black decides to advance ...f7-f5 when it
is more effective, and now the knight sacrifice at f4 becomes more and more of
a reality. It was with the aim of preparing the sacrifice that Black chose his
following move, which seems completely natural - the doubling of rooks on the
c-file followed by play on the queenside.}) 18. Rfc1 {Completely trusting the
opponent. White wants to begin 'smoking out' the black pieces by Bf1 and then
to find a convenient moment to carry out mass exchanges. An ending will be
very favourable for him, in view of the fact that Black's knight at h5 and
bishop at g7 are stuck on the kingside and cannot easily be switched to the
defence.} Rac8 {Sixteen minutes were spent considering this obvious move -
Black was weighing up whether or not the idea, carried out a little later,
would work now. No, it does not work. The variation has to be strengthened.}
19. Kh2 {A move which would have been very useful (he moves his king off the
back rank, defending in case of necessity the g3-pawn), were it not for the
real danger suddenly impending over White's position. Botvinnik evidently
assumed that there were absolutely no threats and decided to make a useful
prophylactic move, intending to follow up with either Bf3 or Bf1.} ({It is
true that even after the immediate} 19. Bf3 {(or Bf1) there would have followed

provoked by this move was, in my opinion, rather pointless. It is good, in
that all other continuations are bad, and if the knight sacrifice is incorrect,
then a question mark should be attached not to Black's 21st move, but, say, to
his 17th. All the same, after the knight sacrifice Black's pieces (this
applies especially to the recently 'unemployed' bishop at g7) become very
active over the entire board and White is obliged to switch to the concrete
analysis of numerous sharp variations. The acceptance of the sacrifice is
forced.} 22. gxf4 exf4 23. Bd2 ({'} 23. a3 {would have won the game'. This was

position.}) ({It is hardly worth trying to convince the reader that Black had
evaluated in detail all the variations and had decided that the knight
sacrifice at f4 would win. Rather, 21...Nf4 was a purely positional sacrifice.
Let us in fact look at the position that arises in the variation recommended
by Goldberg after} 23. a3 Qb3 24. Bxa7 {. --- For the moment White's extra
piece does not play a part, especially as Black can shut it out of the game by
...b7-b6, whereas both black bishops are extremely active, and can operate
both on the queenside and on the kingside. White's queenside is also rather
rigid, and his king's protection is weakened. Thus Black's positional
compensation is evident, and the question to be answered by a detailed
analysis is whether he can transform it into something more tangible. I was
intending to continue} Be5 {, threatening 25...f3+. White has three ways of
defending: he can retreat his king to g1, or he can prevent the opening of the
diagonal by 25 f3 or 25 Bf3. Let us consider these continuations in turn.} 25.

, and after} 25. Kg1 b6 {,} 26. Qd1 Qxb2 27. Ra2 Rxc3 $1 {does not help. It
follows that White cannot release his bishop, and if so, then the position is
materially equal but in practice favourable for Black.}) ({. Things are much
more difficult for Black if White does not retreat his king to the back rank.} 
25. f3 {. On the one hand, with this move White intends to return the
'runaway' from a7, but on the other hand he completely blocks in the other
bishop at g2. Black replies with the routine} b6 {,} 26. -- ({when} 26. Qf2 {
is ineffective, as Black continues} Bd4 {and then ...Be3 with gain of tempo.})

nothing better than to force a draw, either by going for perpetual check, or
by continuing} 32. Qxf4 Ree2 33. Qg3 {. These variations do not cause any
arguments.})) ({. The most interesting play results from 25 Bf3. The analysis
of this continuation was the reason given by Goldberg for claiming Black's
combination to be completely incorrect. The fact that the position is by no
means as simple as Goldberg writes, is convincingly demonstrated by
Konstantinopolsky in his analysis on the pages of the 'Moscow Chess Bulletin'.
During the game I was also intending to sacrifice my queen in this variation,
but I avoided calculating further, reckoning that Black gains real
compensation. Konstantinopolsky found a very interesting tactical confirmation
of this. After the moves} 25. Bf3 b6 26. Qd1 Qxb2 27. Ra2 Rxc3 {(It is

very recently were 'occupied' with the queenside, suddenly switch to a direct

moment the material deficit is not felt. It is possible that ways of improving
White's defence will subsequently be found, but the present commentary by no
means claims to be a detailed analysis of all the variations that could have
occurred. Its role is to reveal the course of the struggle through the eyes of
one of the participants, and from this point of view I am convinced that the
double-edged knight sacrifice at f4 was the correct decision.}))) 23... Qxb2 {
. It is interesting that on the move after the knight sacrifice Black thought
for 15 minutes. Was this the result of an oversight? Or a desire to check the
variations? Neither one, nor the other. It was merely a confirmation, so to
speak, of the intuitive nature of the sacrifice, a confirmation that Black had
not calculated variations beginning with the sacrifice and ending in mate.

be incorrect.} ({While I was thinking, I had already written down on my

Black. When I played the text-move, I reckoned that the game should end in a

by Black could have rebounded on him, but all this occurred because of his

the capture on f3 to be favourable to Black, and he preferred the immediate
exchange of queens. Psychologically this is quite understandable: when you are

did not give cause for such a measure, but the feeling, when the clocks are

1. e4 e6 $1 {What is this, immodesty? Even the most subjective of chess
players has never given an exclamation mark to this move, which has been known
for a long time. But should this move deserve approval (for reasons not
appertaining to chess), then the immodesty of the annotator is not so great.
He really only deserves half an exclamation mark, the other half being due to
A. Koblents, since it was during the process of preparing for this game that
the idea of playing the French Defence occurred to us, although I have adopted
this opening very, very rarely, and without great success. Even so, the choice
of such a variation must have been an unpleasant surprise for Fischer, since
positions of this type have occurred in his games very rarely, and a study of
his games showed that the American Champion feels much less confident in
unfamiliar positions. To be honest I should admit that, after deciding prior
to the game to play the French Defence, at the board it took me about 10

1960 chess bulletins a note by international master Konstantinopolsky appeared,

remember how, before the match with Botvinnik, Koblents and I spent some
considerable time playing through these variations, though at the time we were
unable to test them, since in the 1960 match Botvinnik did not adopt this
system. --- A short time later chess magazines all over the world, including

{Every year traditional Christmas tournaments are held in a number of towns.
The best known competition of this type is the tournament in the small English
town of Hastings, which was first held as early as 1895. Recently they have
begun to hold such tournaments in Holland (Beverwijk), and also in Sweden. ---
It was to the New Year tournament in Stockholm that Soviet grandmasters Kotov
and I were invited. It should be added that the 1960-1961 Tournament was timed
to coincide with an important jubilee of the Swedish Chess Organisation. Early
in 1911 the Stockholm Chess Club was formed, and for half a century now it has
been the centre for Swedish chess players. Therefore, the Jubilee Tournament
was, if one can so express it, especially festive. --- We arrived in the
Swedish capital on 28th December at 10 o'clock local time. It turned out that
we had been expected since the previous evening, but even so we had flown in
just at the right time - we still had at our disposal a whole half hour before
the start of a televised game. Of course, the time set aside for us to rest
flew past unnoticed, and when we assembled in the television studio, we felt
somewhat exhausted. --- My opponent was the well known Swedish Grandmaster
Ståhlberg. The time control was not altogether normal - 50 minutes for the
whole game, so that the viewers should be able to follow the game in its
entirety. Thinking, however, that to follow the game for two hours at a
stretch would also not be easy, the Swedish television authorities decided to
extend the pleasure over three days. This was perhaps more interesting for the
spectators, and also less tiring for the participants, since every 35-40
minutes there was an interval. Grandmaster Kotov took the role of commentator.
Now I can perhaps disclose a small secret. The game was shown from 6th to 8th
January, and the participants had to give their word that until the end of the
transmission no word of the game was to appear in the press. Therefore I only
had the chance to 'boast' about my win following the conclusion of the
tournament.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3 ({In

{Immediately after the Individual Championship, the Team Championship Final
began in Moscow. --- Before this I spent a further day in bed in Baku - once
again I was suffering from kidney colic - and then, in Moscow, almost straight
from the plane, I sat down to play against Smyslov. It is true that the
reserve for our team did everything he could to persuade me to rest,
promising to play successfully, but I nevertheless decided not to dishearten
my team at the very start of the final, and I played against Smyslov until I
felt that I was unable to continue. As a result I drew four games, including,
it is true, two fighting ones, against Korchnoi and Petrosian, and lost one. I
lost because my opponent Stein, readily and with astonishment, made exactly
the winning moves that I had recommended in my notes to some game, and about
which I had completely forgotten during play. --- Even so, it hardly occurred
to me that the third act of this kidney tragi-comedy might occur at, of all
possible times, the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao.} 1. -- {After the
tournament in Moscow, I was not feeling too well, and it was decided to send
me to Marianske Lazne, the world-famous resort. Just before my departure a
deterioration set in, and within 24 hours I had been taken to hospital, put on
the table, and operated upon. The operation was performed by an excellent
surgeon, a veritable grandmaster of world medicine, Professor Frumkin. This
was, unfortunately, to be one of the last operations of his life. When we were
talking before the operation I asked him to bear in mind the fact that within
two months I had to travel to Curaçao, and that it would be good if he could
repeat the 'miracle' of 1959, when after the removal of my appendix I won the
Candidates Tournament. --- The professor listened to my request, and operated
most carefully, but, alas, history did not repeat itself. --- On coming out of
hospital, I began my preparations, and I played two training games against
Gipslis with a shortened time limit - 40 moves in 1½ hours. I played quite
well, and decided that everything was alright. Subsequently, in Curaçao, it
became clear that I was only capable of playing for those same first three
hours in a competitive game. I only found out about this later, and in the
plane, crossing the Atlantic for the first time, I was firmly resolved to
obtain once again an audition with Botvinnik.} (1. -- {JOURNALIST. Did you
know how the other contestants rated your prospects? --- CHESS PLAYER. How
could I? I read the papers, where your colleagues, from force of habit, rated
my chances quite highly, and I agreed with them! Although photographs taken
before the flight show that prior to the tournament I looked somewhat
emaciated. --- The first round in no way warned me, although I adjourned my
game against Petrosian in a lost position. The usual first round result, I
decided. Then the second game, against Keres, made me suspicious. At first
everything went well; I sacrificed my queen and obtained an advantage
sufficient to win, but then came the fifth hour of play, that same hour that
had always brought me so many dividends in the past. Here, however, I began
playing quite terribly. Then in the third round against Benko, in a
time-scramble, in which I had so many times swindled the American Grandmaster,
I myself was swindled. Nought out of three! It was clear: never in my life had
I been in such poor form. For four hours, even four hours and a quarter,
everything was normal, but then a reaction took place, I lost my orientation,
and gave away points with exceptional generosity.}) *

{I gained my first half point in the fourth round against Fischer, which, I
must admit, fairly surprised me. Even then the Achilles' Heel of the future
World Champion - a dislike of sharp, irrational positions - was known. By
embroiling him in this sort of play, I adjourned the game with an advantage,
but Black's sealed move came like a thunderclap.} 41... Rxd5 $3 42. exd5 Bh6 {
, and Black, by placing his bishop on f4, supporting it with his g-pawn, and
giving up his e-pawn by ...e4!, obtained an impregnable position.} (42... -- {
Things continued in the same way. I finished the first cycle with 2 points out
of 7, alone in last place. However, my natural optimism urged me on, and, with
21 games still to go - a whole tournament! - somewhere in my mind I 'changed
my schedule'. Seeing that the competitors at Curaçao were playing more
reservedly than in Yugoslavia three years previously, and that the number of
points required for first place - I didn't even consider any other! - would be
less, I decided to steal up on them. --- Then the second round began with me
playing what was probably the worst game of my life. As White against
Petrosian in a French Defence, somewhere around move 8 I thought for more than
an hour, trying to choose between one of two normal continuations, both of
which would give White an opening advantage. --- First I wrote down one move,
then the other (incidentally, two rounds later, I adopted the second against
Benko, and won, while Spassky played the first against Petrosian a year later,
and also won), and, being unable to decide which was the stronger, I suddenly
made a third, ridiculous move. By move 13 White already stood worse, and then
in addition I immediately blundered away a bishop.}) (42... -- {In this cycle
I suffered a further three successive defeats, when I declined a draw offered
by Fischer, and ruined excellent attacking positions against Filip and Geller,
losing to each of them for the first time. Even my first ever win against
Korchnoi did not especially cheer me. With one half of the tournament gone, I
had moved up one place - to last but one! - with 4½ points. However, the
leaders had 'only' 9! I spent the two-week break still hoping to rest and
regain my form, and with the belief that I would win almost every game in the
3rd and 4th cycles. --- I began with the firm desire to effect an immediate
change. Indeed, against Petrosian, I succeeded in seizing the initiative as
Black, and, frightening my opponent with a combinative threat, won a pawn. ---
I was later told of the dialogue which took place at this point between the
Soviet trainer Boleslavsky and Petrosian's anxious wife. Replying to Rona
Yakovlevna, the imperturbable Boleslavsky remarked that Petrosian stood badly
at the moment, but that what Tal would do in the fifth hour of play was
anybody's guess. I didn't 'do' a great deal - I lost the greater part of my
advantage, and in the adjourned position Petrosian had every chance of a draw.
--- Even so, this game seemed a good omen to me, but the next one - with Keres
- was the last one that I played with any hope of success in the tournament.
By success, I repeat, I mean only first place. --- I thought up a very
interesting combination, and after making a preparatory move, I even went up
to Petrosian and joked: 'I'm going for the brilliancy prize'. The point was
that, in my preliminary calculations, I was planning to sacrifice my queen for
only two minor pieces, but after writing down Qh5, which would have led to the
sacrifice, I instead changed my mind and played Qf3, forgetting about Black's
obvious reply. Within two moves, not a trace of my attack remained, but I was
a pawn down, and soon had to resign. --- It was only then that it became clear
to me that it was time to give up the tournament as lost. After this I played
much more calmly, even imperturbably, and scored four draws - an achievement!
- plus a loss to Geller. In this game I had the advantage, but all the time I
was disturbed by the question: was it right for me, when in my heart I had
given up the fight for first place, to play for a win which would upset the
positions of the leaders: Petrosian, Keres and Geller. At the same time it was
awkward to offer a draw: after all, Geller could hope for me to blunder in the
fifth hour. So, tormented by doubts, I forgot about my clock until I noticed
that I had only a few minutes remaining, whereupon I began playing at blitz
speed. When the time-scramble was over, it turned out that on the way I could
have won White's queen in one move, but in the adjourned position it was
Geller who had the advantage.}) (42... -- {I was intending to play the fourth
cycle without any ambition at all, and perhaps it was because of this that I
had a recurring attack of my illness. Then another, and another. In short, I
went into a local hospital, and there, by the united efforts of the doctors,
the other players, the controllers and the leader of our delegation, I was
persuaded to stop playing. Although I had never withdrawn from an event
through illness since the time of the 4th category tournament and scarlet
fever, I did this with a relatively quiet mind: all seven of my opponents
would be equally affected by my withdrawal. --- After the return home, and a
break of several months, came the Olympiad in Varna. I was included in the
USSR team only, of course, after lengthy debates, and the medical inspection
was 'not inferior' in severity to that which cosmonauts have to undergo. I
managed to overcome this obstacle, and was given the place of second reserve.
--- In my first games I played like a man making his first steps after a long
illness, but as early as the third game (with Mohrlok) I succeeded with an
attractive attack, in which, unfortunately, the main variation remained behind
the scenes. --- In this event I played quite well. True, I did not perform as
a recent World Champion should (on the fourth board the opponents were not as
strong or experienced as those on board one), but well enough to take first
place on my board. --- The following game was unofficially judged to be the
most brilliant played in the Olympiad (see the following game).}) *

-- {Nevertheless, for me the most memorable event of the Olympiad was the
resumption of the Botvinnik-Fischer game. The question of which team would
take first place was already decided, but for this game chess fans gathered
from literally all over Bulgaria. Everyone remembered the recent interview
given by Fischer, in which he had said that he could beat Botvinnik in a match,
and the game therefore held exceptional prestige interest. --- My game,
against D. Byrne, was also adjourned, in an ending slightly favourable for me,
but no-one, myself included, looked at it seriously. Three of us, Boleslavsky,
Spassky and I, set up Botvinnik's position in our room, and got down to
analysing it. We were not the only ones. When, on the advice of our trainer
Boleslavsky, I went off to the family room of Donald and Robert Byrne to offer
a draw, I saw on their table the adjourned position of the Botvinnik-Fischer
game. --- The analysis went on for almost the whole of the night. The three of
us worked together, as did Botvinnik, Geller, Keres and Furman on the floor
above. From time to time the younger players, Spassky and I, would take turns
to go upstairs and exchange conclusions. --- Towards five o' clock in the
morning, Geller's fantastic idea - to battle with two isolated pawns against
two united pawns in a rook ending - had been fully worked out, and we decided
that there were considerable drawing chances. And when, for the last time, we
set off downstairs to sleep Mikhail Moiseyevich said to us: 'Please, if anyone
asks, tell them my position is hopeless!'. We overslept, and missed breakfast
by a long time, but when we arrived in the restaurant we found the Americans
there. They looked sleepy, but contented: they were in no doubt that Fischer's
position was won. --- When we all arrived at the overcrowded tournament hall,
we found the following picture: Botvinnik walking calmly up and down the stage,
Fischer sitting with his head in his hands, and a theoretically drawn position
already on the board.}) (49. -- {The Varna Olympiad helped considerably in
re-establishing my self-confidence. --- Otherwise it is difficult to explain
my result in the USSR Team Championship, which began immediately afterwards in
Leningrad. As always, the opposition on board one was pretty strong, and as
usual my games were aggressive, but even so, in the first 7 rounds I scored 7
(!!) draws. Then, in the last round, an amusing situation arose. The point was
that on the top board, along with Spassky, Keres, Geller, Smyslov and
Boleslavsky, there was a candidate master from Moldavia, Shofman. He had seven
noughts, I had seven draws, and we had to play each other in the last round.
Everyone tried to guess whose tradition would be broken: mine, his, or both
together if he should win. I managed to 'change my principle', and Shofman's
series continued. --- Despite my suddenly acquired reputation as a 'drawing
king', I travelled to the Individual Championship of the USSR in Yerevan in a
good frame of mind, since I felt that with each succeeding month I was
approaching my previous form. --- In Yerevan I started well, and one of my
games, the one with Bannik, is given here. I was flattered by the assessment
given to this game by Petrosian: 'Even if I don't say who made the combination,
it is clear all the same: from far off it smells of Tal!' I was going well: 4
out of 5, 5 out of 6. Then, in quick succession, came defeats at the hands of
the experienced masters Mikenas and Aronin. Nevertheless, drawing few games, I
was still a contender for first place. This continued until my game with
Korchnoi, who was playing splendidly. The pairings had placed Spassky and
myself next to each other in the tournament table, and now Korchnoi first
defeated Boris with Black, and then me with White, when he boldly and
confidently left himself only seconds for his last few moves, but on the other
hand had everything weighed up! --- This game evidently made such demands on
Victor's stamina, that towards the end of the tournament he played much less
strongly. I scored 4½ points from my last 5 games, but this was sufficient
only to enable me to share 2nd-3rd places with Taimanov, half a point behind
Korchnoi. There was some consolation for me (although I did not consider that
I had performed badly) in the form of several special prizes, including one
for the most interesting game played in the Championship.}) 1-0

{The New Year, 1963, found me in hospital. An examination had shown that a
repeat operation was necessary. It was carried out by a pupil of the late
Professor Frumkin, who, according to his teacher, was knowledgeable. The
operation took place in Moscow, and on this occasion a thorough job was made
of it, since in the first half of the year I had nothing especially important
planned in chess. The operation was completed successfully, and after leaving
hospital I remained in Moscow, trying my hand for the first time in a new
field, as chess correspondent for the paper Soviet Sport, during the match for
the chess crown between Botvinnik and Petrosian. It was with pleasure that I
'avenged' myself upon my colleagues, discovering in analysis their mistakes.
My first experience showed me that the work was difficult, interesting, and
beneficial. It also had repercussions of a purely chess nature. Whereas
earlier I had played 1 e4 and 1 d4 on the first move with roughly equal
frequency, two months of observing the problems of isolated and hanging pawns
left me so sated with their taste, that for a long time after this I simply
avoided 1 d4. --- In the summer, the time came for me myself to play, and I
realised that sometimes a lengthy chess starvation can be beneficial. I
travelled with Bronstein to Miskolc, where my play was easy and unrestrained,
which is apparent if only from the games against Ghitescu and Bilek given in
this book. --- I practically assured myself of first place some 3-4 rounds
before the finish. Then the USSR Peoples' Spartakiad was held once again. My
result was more satisfactory than the one three years earlier, but our team
only reached the second final group, not the main one, and so for part of the
event I was playing against less experienced masters. Nevertheless, several of
the games proved to be of interest.} 39. -- ({The positioning of the black
pieces appears dubious, and if White had chosen, say,} 39. a4 {, radically
preventing the counterblow ...b5, he could hardly have lost.}) ({However, the
position 'urged' White to try for more, and he adopted determined measures:} 
39. c5 $2 Bxf1 40. cxb6 Rxb6 41. Na4 Rb5 $1 42. Kxf1 Nxd4 43. Rxd4 Nc6 {, and
Black's pieces had so come to life that White was unable to save the game.}) ({
I had been hoping to lure Mnatsakanian into a quite different combination:} 39.

43. Rd6+ Kf7 44. Nxb8 Bxf1 45. Kxf1 -- ({he cannot play} 45... Rxb8 {on
account of} 46. Rxd7+ {.}) ({However, the quiet} 45... Ke7 $1 {would suddenly
reveal that White's spectacular combination has led only to his defeat.})) (39.
-- {In the second half of the year I took greater steps to make up for my
previous lack of activity, and took part in a further three tournaments. The
first was in Havana. Not without a certain trepidation, caused by memories of
Curaçao, I flew across the ocean, but on this occasion my kidneys behaved
themselves perfectly. The tournament itself can be put down in my chess
biography as one of those in which I was satisfied with the result, but in no
way with my play. --- The participants were very varied in strength, and if
one's game is 'overworked' this is always dangerous. When, in the first round,
I failed to win a won pawn(!!) ending against Pachman, and in the second round
overcame Jimenez only with difficulty, and not really deservedly, much became
clear to me. Nevertheless, taking into account the fact that, in order to win
in such a mixed tournament of Grandmasters, masters, candidate masters and
even first category players (measuring according to standards familiar to me),
a high percentage of points would be required, I tried to take a hold on
myself. As a result I drew few games, but lost three. One of these was as
White to Trifunovic. I was already well acquainted with his tenacity, and
before the game Geller and I selected one of the variations of the Queen's
Gambit, but while the high-speed lift was taking us from the 28th floor of the
hotel 'Havana Libre', where we were staying, to the ground floor, I suddenly
thought: 'Why play the Queen's Gambit when there is the King's?' I began to
play sharply, which is always not without its dangers, the more so when one is
playing 'creakily'. In short, by move 15 my position was already in ruins.
Although I felt that it would be worth offering a draw, for Trifunovic might
well accept - he had drawn all his games up till then! - I didn't have the
courage to make this 'move'. Some ten moves later I resigned. --- Somewhere in
the middle of the tournament came the important game between Korchnoi and
myself. Up till then I had hardly lost to him as Black, and after a very sharp
struggle this game also ended in a draw. And for a week, Korchnoi suddenly
stopped speaking to me. At the end of the week I lost to the Cuban Calero (it
was his only win) in a game where I twice had a completely won position, but
twice blundered, on the second occasion losing my queen. After this there was
still a draw to be had, but I blundered for the third and last time. The first
person who came to console me was Korchnoi. When I enquired as to what had
provoked his week-long hostility, he answered in his usual direct way: 'Well,
you see, I reckoned up, and decided that I would have to win against you,
otherwise you would take first place. No one thought that you would lose to
Calero!' --- Indeed, finishing with 8½ points out of 9, which included a
90-move win against Geller, I nevertheless ended up half a point behind
Korchnoi, as did Geller and Pachman. There was a great contrast between this,
the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, and the International Tournament which
started immediately after it in the Moscow Central Chess Club. Here my result
was roughly equivalent, but I was much more satisfied with my play. I am
inclined to think that the prize I received for interesting play was more or
less deserved. The reader can find two of the games, against Gligoric and
Padevsky, in this book.}) (39. -- {An amusing episode accompanied the start of
this tournament. The day before, on the birthday of one of my friends, by no
means a chess player, someone suddenly expressed the desire that in my game
with the Dutchman Kuijpers the following day I should sacrifice something.
'Which piece, and on which square would you like?', I asked jokingly. 'Well,
let's say a knight on e6' --- The following day I had naturally forgotten this
conversation, and my game with Kuijpers first proceeded quietly, and then
became more complicated in the time-scramble. I made a move, and with
time-trouble over, Kuijpers realised that mate was inevitable, and resigned.
In the foyer my delighted friends gathered round. --- 'Good man! Did you do it
on purpose?' --- 'Do what?' --- 'Well, make that last move with your knight to
e6?' --- I immediately remembered, and realised that my chess prestige in
these circles had risen sharply, and so as to maintain this, I pompously asked:
'What would you like me to sacrifice tomorrow, and where?' --- For a moment my
friends were taken aback, and since no recommendation was given, my draw in
the second round was put down to their 'indifference' to me. --- I would also
like to mention the difference in my play with White and Black in this
tournament, rather unusual for me. As White I drew only one game, but as Black
I lost one game and drew the remainder, including one against the Polish
player Balcerowski who finished last. --- Two of the other encounters are also
worth recalling: those with Smyslov and Liberzon. During the first stage of
our chess 'relationship', when playing against Vasily Vasilyevich, I was
terribly afraid of transposing into an endgame. Here as Black I calmly went
into an ending, and one that was somewhat inferior. Up to a certain point
Smyslov played brilliantly, and achieved a great deal, and in desperation I
gave up the exchange without gaining the slightest compensation. Then Smyslov
decided to convert his advantage into a win without giving me the slightest
counter-chance, and began playing somewhat listlessly, whereupon my king
penetrated into the white position onto the square e3. At the time of the
sealed move, I was even of the opinion that Black's chances were by no means
worse. --- This was not shaken even by the radio report, which said that
Smyslov was the exchange ahead, and had a winning position.}) *

{JOURNALIST. Who was the commentator? --- CHESS PLAYER. Not you, not you,
don't get alarmed. --- Evidently Smyslov did not believe the radio assessment
of the position either, for the day before the resumption he offered a draw.
--- My one nought in the table came in my game against Liberzon, when - and
this happens to me - in an equal and quiet ending with opposite-coloured
bishops I simply lost patience. We were playing in the small room of the
Central Chess Club, from where it was easy to go up to the spectators, and
Liberzon, after making a move, immediately went over to his family who were in
the hall, and began talking in very lively style with them about something.
This suddenly infuriated me, and in quite ridiculous fashion I began playing
for a win, which, as is well known, is almost always equivalent to playing for
a loss. --- My third individual tournament in a row was the Championship of
Moscow University in lightning chess, in which some of our guests,
participants in the Central Chess Club Tournament, took part. Of the 19 games
I lost one, drew none, and came ahead of Kholmov (who took second place) by 2½ points. ---

Qxf3 Qxf3 36. Nc4 g4 {. For me the year 1964 was to be sated with chess. I
started it, and spent the whole of it, sitting at the chessboard. It was in a
'new country' for me, England, that I saw the New Year in, at the ancient
International Tournament held in Hastings. --- Here everything reminded one of
chess and non-chess battles. William the Conqueror, the victory of Harry
Nelson Pillsbury in the famous tournament of 1895. How much I was to read
about all this! --- The tournament went well for me, although in view of the
short distance (at that time the Hastings Tournament always comprised five
English players and five foreigners) I was rather afraid of a recurrence of my
old illness - a loss in the first round. Just imagine trying to catch up after
such a slip! --- The contenders for first place were the old hand of the
tournament: the Yugoslav Grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, and its debutante
myself. Neither of us was defeated, but I won one game more. Hastings took a
leaf, as it were, out of Havana: there was nothing to boast about regarding my
play. An exception should perhaps be made of my game with Gligoric, in which a
place was found for an attack, a counter-attack, a combination and a
counter-combination. --- Apart from myself and the master Khasin, the Soviet
Chess Federation also sent the young Lady World Champion, Nona Gaprindashvili,
to Hastings to play in a secondary tournament. At that time she was still a
first-year student of English. --- She was, of course, the centre of general
attention, but we helped her to overcome her embarrassment, and in addition A.
Khasin, a professional teacher of English, would reply to the endless
questions from journalists. I recall the question which Nona was asked
particularly often: 'What do you think of English men?' At first Nona used to
answer with embarrassment, and not altogether tactfully: 'Not much, thank
you!' Then one day she called me over, and asked me: 'Misha, it's awkward for
me; say that I like them, but that I like Georgian men better!' --- Directly
from England, Nona and I set off for Iceland. Gligoric also arrived, the
Icelandic Grandmaster Olafsson was included, together with a number of other
players, and we all played in one tournament: 13 men and one girl. --- Here
the Gligoric-Tal race began. The result was that I scored 12½ out of 13,
and Gligoric a point less.} (36... -- {Three rounds before the finish, the
interval was only half a point. Gligoric lost to me, winning his remaining
games, while I had somewhere played a draw. On this day a telegram arrived
from Moscow, saying that Nona had been awarded the title of Honoured Master of
Sport of the USSR, and as a senior colleague I arranged a small banquet, to
which a number of the competitors were invited. --- The following day I was
due to play Nona. I didn't think that at that moment I had the right to play
for a win, and so I said to the Lady Champion that I was not averse to
agreeing a draw. To my surprise, Nona displayed her character, and said that,
in view of the close battle for first place, I was obliged to play only for a
win. --- Then I suggested to her that she should name an opening which she
would like me to play, she agreed to this and, naturally without any
additional preparation, I sat down at the board. I now felt more confident,
and even had the right to think of revenge. --- The point was that a New Year
lightning tournament had been held in Hastings, and in the final of this Nona
had scored 3 out of 3, and I only 2. --- I gained my revenge in Reykjavik, and
in the course of play I was once more made aware of the Georgian lady's
champion-like character. Already a pawn down, Nona got into time-trouble, but
when, not wishing to win on time, I 'forgot' to press my clock on a couple of
occasions, Nona said to me in a hissing whisper: 'If you do that again, I'll
resign straight away!' --- Then, in the penultimate round, I won my most
interesting game of the tournament against Olafsson, Gligoric drew, and the
question of first place was decided. --- Then, after a six-year interval, I
once again took part in an Interzonal Tournament. --- Once again the battle
was to finish in the first six, and to come ahead of at least two compatriots:
of the five Soviet Grandmasters, the door to the Candidates cycle was to be
opened to only three.}) (36... -- {In addition, there was the
not-exactly-clever rule of the forced draw (Editor's note: Players from one
country were given pairing numbers so that they played each other as early as
possible in the tournament. This meant that these players had consecutive
numbers in the draw, and consequently the remaining players often had to play 
(say) five or six Soviet Grandmasters in succession.), and it was very
important at which stage of the tournament a player would encounter the
'Russian row'. For Larsen, for instance, it occurred at the finish, when he
had already assured himself of a place in the first six, and therefore he was
able to play calmly. Gligoric was less fortunate: he played against the Soviet
Grandmasters earlier and, after dropping several points, became nervous. For
us too, it was not very pleasant to have to play one difficult game after
another without a break. --- My game in the second round with Portisch gave me
a number of difficult moments, and later even became tragi-comic. Having
decided that the most important thing was to play the opening originally, I
fully succeeded in my intention but then had to sacrifice to maintain the fire.
Portisch captured my pieces, and I, with nothing to lose, broke up his king's
position by the advance of my rook's pawn. At some point Portisch could have
allowed me to win his queen, gaining for it almost a complete set of the other
pieces, but he did not want this, and in a severe time-scramble we repeated
the position. --- When the draw had been agreed, Portisch somewhat perplexedly
asked me whether he could have played better. I just waved my hands. --- Later,
when he had cooled down after the game, Portisch admitted that he had been
expecting my capitulation at any moment, and the fact that I did not resign
had put the normally calm Hungarian Grandmaster out of his stride. --- This
game did me a good practical service. A year later we met in the Candidates
Matches, and it was our game from the Interzonal that showed me, firstly, that
Portisch was somewhat afraid of me, and, secondly, that such play could
confuse my erudite, experienced and formidable opponent. --- To return to the
Interzonal, after five draws at the start against the Soviet Grandmasters and
Portisch, I managed to win several games, and finished the tournament in
1st-4th places. I thus became one of the Candidates, but was not especially
pleased with the 'Battle of Amsterdam'.}) (36... -- {JOURNALIST. Is your play
affected when you have to set yourself a goal in an event? --- CHESS PLAYER.
More likely it is affected by a different sort of stimulus. Perhaps if I had
lost one of the games where I had a very dubious position, to Portisch,
Foguelman or Gligoric, everything would have turned out differently. As it was,
my results in the tournament table had a rather grey appearance. With those
who finished in the upper half, I drew, while the 'tail' was 'cut off'. One of
the more or less interesting games, with Evans, is given here. --- Besides
this, I was given great pleasure by the first game in my life with the veteran
S. Reshevsky. Prior to this, I had read that the American Grandmaster did not
devote a great deal of attention to the opening, and that in his youth he had
been very formidable in time-scrambles. Now, on the strength of my own
experience, I became convinced of the 100% accuracy of this characterisation.
This was one of the few games where I succeeded in catching my opponent in a
prepared variation, which, strange as it may seem, is contrary to my normal
way of playing. --- It is one thing, when you yourself are playing from the
first few minutes, and something quite different when the game begins at about
move 20, as it did against Reshevsky. Everyone reckoned that the end was in
sight, for my positional advantage was considerable, and the difference in
time simply colossal. On these 20 moves I had spent about 10 minutes, which
was necessary for the purely technical operations of writing down the move,
moving the piece, and pressing the clock, while Reshevsky had only 15 minutes
left! Taking all this into account, I was physically unable to force myself to
deal the finishing blow with the necessary energy. I began playing from
inertia, as it were, whereas time after time Reshevsky would discover
exceptional defensive resources. Then I sacrificed a piece, whereupon the game
became tactical, and I was greatly impressed by the way that Reshevsky, with
1-2 minutes for 10 moves, would hold his hand over the board and quite
impulsively grasp the very piece that was required, and make with it the only
saving move. Finally, in a more or less equal position, Reshevsky offered me a
draw. I had also read that he would do this when he was in a bad position, and
I searched very carefully for what Reshevsky might be afraid of. I found
nothing, agreed to a draw, and then the American Grandmaster revealed that it
wasn't the position on the board that he was afraid of, but the opponent - at
any rate, during this game. --- Taking into account the specific nature of the
tournament, the position before the 22nd and penultimate round remained tense:
at least four of the five Soviet Grandmasters had real chances of success.
Someone had to be the 'superfluous fourth', and it was Leonid Stein who
stumbled. For the second time running he did not reach the Candidates because
of the discrimination, although he took a place which was sufficient for any
non-Soviet player. In the last round, the Bulgarian Grandmaster Tringov
literally forced me, with his risky play, to carry out a combination with a
sacrifice of two pieces, although at this moment there was no real need to
take any risks (see the following game).}) 0-1

{The year ended for me in Kiev, where I participated in the USSR Championship.
--- Here, unfortunately, I caught a cold, which made itself felt. In the first
round it was by no means because of this that I lost to Bronstein, in a game
from which I gained enormous pleasure. The manoeuvre of Black's king from e8
to f6 simply staggered me. --- After this failure at the start, followed by a
few draws, I reached the 50% level by winning against Vasiukov. In this game,
I spent 40 minutes on my 19th move 'dragging the hippopotamus out of the
marsh', which I have talked about earlier. --- In the next round I was once
again down to '-1', then two rounds later up to '+ 1', and after the 9th round
I fell ill. The day before, I had adjourned my game against Korchnoi, and on
subsequent resumption a drawn position was reached: rook and pawn against
bishop and pawn. Since it was Korchnoi who had the rook, we carried on playing.
On and on we played, and just when I could have saved the half point
practically as I pleased, he nevertheless 'outplayed' me: I chose for my
bishop almost the only losing square, and there arose a new theoretical
position, but this time with a different assessment. --- Under the doctor's
instructions, I played several of the games in my hotel room. The majority of
my opponents readily agreed to this, realising that it was not I who was being
capricious, but others proved less compliant, and insisted that play should
take place only in the tournament hall. Need it be said that I doubled my
efforts in these games, and won them both. In winning against Shamkovich, I
seriously spoiled his tournament position: up till then he had been amongst
the leaders. With Sakharov also, the game proved to be fairly 'ruthless'. ---
The majority of the commentators assessed my overall result (3rd place) as
quite good, taking into account my illness, but there were no special creative
achievements. I will give only the concluding attack against Shamkovich.} 32.

{When I drew the number 13 in the Havana Tournament, the other players, the
controllers and spectators greeted this with jovial applause. Strictly
speaking, I had no grounds for complaining of any obvious ill fortune in the
tournament, and I would even say that, prior to the game given below, I had
more points than I deserved. Even so, for player number 13 the 13th round is
dangerous. I suspect that, having successfully negotiated this hurdle, (this
was the critical game) I was so inspired by this achievement that the
following day I lost to a player, who thus obtained, as it turned out at the
end of the tournament, his only win. It seems that there are other numbers
which are also dangerous ...} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. c3 {

variation of Black's, introduced into tournament practice by Smyslov, has been

for his game with Ivkov, we began to analyse the move 14 b3 which, strange as
it may seem, turned out to be a theoretical innovation. The effect of it was
startling. In Havana Geller won against Ivkov, in Moscow I defeated Matanovic

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d5 {The sharp, impulsive play of my opponent has gained him
widespread popularity in chess circles, but on this occasion (whether or not
with the aim of maintaining his reputation) he chooses an over-sharp
continuation. Perhaps the fact that Lutikov had been successful in our
previous encounters played a certain role in the choice of this variation,
together with the considerable psychological effect of the novelty. Indeed, I
had never previously encountered in tournament practice the position after
Black's 2nd move. White's first task was at least to remember the name of this
opening. At the board I did not succeed in solving this problem. The second
was to recall any games previously played with this variation. With this
second problem I coped rather more successfully. There flashed through my mind
the encounter between Boleslavsky and Lilienthal (Match-Tournament for the
title of Absolute Champion of the USSR, 1941) and the notes by Botvinnik to
this game, from which it was clear that the move played by Boleslavsky, 3 Nxe5,
is not the strongest (after it Black could have equalised) and that 3 exd5
should be played. --- A game by Konstantinopolsky from the World
Correspondence Team Championship was published in one of the chess yearbooks
in which the Soviet master played 3 exd5, and won. Thus equipped with a solid
theoretical support, I decided to follow Botvinnik's recommendation.} 3. exd5

{This game was played in the last round, with two players - Stein and I - in
joint first position, while Grandmaster Averbakh was just half a step behind.
Thus White's tactics appeared to be simple enough - play for a win, avoid
losing, and follow the events on the neighbouring board (where Averbakh was
playing Stein). It is well known that Master Fuchs (along with many other
leading East German players) invariably answers 1 e4 with 1...e6, and has
frequently upheld Black's cause in the most intricate variations. Not feeling
inclined to conduct a theoretical discussion on 'French' affairs, I decided to
go in for another topical variation (the so-called 'Meran'), which also occurs
frequently in Fuchs's games, and whose complications I consider to be very
attractive for White.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5 {Here White felt
dejected. His psychology had 'worked', but this move is just what he did not
want. In place of a sharp struggle he has prospects of some dreary queenside
pressure. Nevertheless ...} 5. cxd5 cxd5 ({Markedly weaker is} 5... Nxd5 {
because of} 6. Bc4 e6 7. Nge2 {soon to be followed by a comfortable pawn
advance in the centre.}) 6. Qb3 ({With} 6. Qb3 {, White was wearily expecting
the natural (although at the same time paradoxical)} Bc8 {, after which it is
very difficult for White to exploit his lead in development.}) 6... Qb6 {...and the searching through my memory began. Unless White wishes to concede that
he has not a shade of an advantage, he must accept the challenge (and take the
pawn).} 7. Nxd5 Nxd5 8. Qxd5 Qb4+ ({After} 8... Qb4+ {I at last remembered
where I had seen this position before. In 1957 the Soviet student team, on its
way back from Reykjavik, played a match against Denmark in Copenhagen. The
experienced master Enevoldsen adopted this same sharp system against Averbakh.
As far as I remember the game continued} 9. Bd2 Qxb2 {, and here Averbakh
dampened his opponent's spirits by playing} 10. Qb5+ {. The ending turned out
to be somewhat to White's advantage. As I found out after the game, my
opponent had observed this variation during a match between East Germany and
Denmark. Black had been the same Enevoldsen, while White had been Uhlmann. In
this game also an ending was quickly reached after White forced the exchange
of queens. It seems to me that White's advantage in the centre, together with
the fact that he can quickly bring his pieces into play, should encourage him
to keep the struggle complicated. The one inconvenient feature of his position
is the awkward situation of his queen in the centre of the board. This can be
easily removed, if the queen is sacrificed.}) 9. Bd2 ({In my opinion,} 9. Kd1
Bd7 {gives Black more than sufficient play for his pawn.}) 9... Qxb2 10. Rc1
Bd7 11. Nf3 e6 12. Qc4 $1 {The imminent opposition of the queen with Black's
rook, which will soon move to c8, is relatively harmless for White.} Nc6 13.
Be2 {After lengthy reflection, White all the same agrees to the exchange of
queens. True, the ending here is much more favourable for him than in the
variation chosen by Averbakh, since Black has had to waste further time.} ({
Instead of 13 Be2, very tempting was} 13. Bd3 {, when} Bb4 {does not achieve
its aim in view of} 14. Rb1 {.}) ({The following interesting variation could
have occurred:} 13. Bd3 Nb4 14. Be4 Rc8 15. Qxc8+ Bxc8 16. Rxc8+ Kd7 17. Rc1

up his queen in a different way, only this time Black is not agreeable.}) 13...

the Gordian knot with his bold queen advance in the opening.})) 14. Bxb4 Qxb4+

{Once again the Caro-Kann... --- In their search for a sound defence against
the 'rust-proof 1 e4, players with Black have been turning more and more
frequently to the (until quite recently) 'half-forgotten' Caro-Kann Defence.
The army of supporters of this opening has already received such
'reinforcements' as Botvinnik and Smyslov, while the present World Champion 
(Petrosian) has been fond of the move 1...c6 'since childhood'. At the start
of the 32nd USSR Championship, Vasiukov was also enlisted into the Caro-Kann
legions. However, his debut in this opening did not turn out very successfully.
In the second round he lost to Bronstein, and in the fourth...} 1. e4 c6 2. Nc3

5. Bc4 Ngf6 6. Ng5 e6 7. Qe2 ({or} 7. Ne2 {. I decided to choose an
old-fashioned system, reckoning that, in order to defend accurately, Black
would require not only knowledge of the opening variation, but also experience,
and, as I have already said, my opponent was somewhat lacking in this.})) 5...
Ngf6 6. Ng3 e6 7. Bd3 c5 8. O-O cxd4 9. Nxd4 Bc5 ({Up till now, all according

clear that Black had an excellent position since White's kingside activity is
hindered by the absence of his knight while his queenside play is hindered by
its presence!}) 10. Nf3 O-O 11. Qe2 b6 {The first, though as yet not
particularly significant, inaccuracy. The place for the black queen in this
variation is on c7, and it is best to begin to develop with this move. From c7

on the h2-b8 diagonal.} 12. Bf4 Bb7 {After this move Black's defence is
already difficult.} ({The bishop should have been harassed immediately. After}

unwieldy rooks).}) 13. Rad1 ({Significantly weaker is} 13. c4 Qc8 $1 {and 14...Qc6. Now this manoeuvre is ruled out because of the move Bb5.}) 13... Nd5 14.

also has one drawback: his knight on h5 is a condemned man, since it is clear
that his only task can be to give himself up on g7. Sensing the danger,
Vasiukov begins to make amends for his opening mistakes, and with a series of
precise moves succeeds in doing this.}) 15... Kh8 $1 (15... Kh8 {is a move

only due to begin in the summer. Both then and now I could not imagine my
preparations being purely theoretical, so after a 7-year interval I decided to
take part in the Latvian Championship, where I assumed the role of favourite.} 
1. -- {JOURNALIST. Let us suppose for the moment that you had a perfectly free
choice of events, and you could play 365 games a year if you wished. How many
would you play, and with what intervals? --- CHESS PLAYER. It's a purely
theoretical question. Sometimes after a tournament I feel so tired that I
promise myself that I won't touch chess at all for a certain length of time.
But a week or 10 days pass, and I once again feel myself being drawn to the
board. So after each tournament, I think that an interval of two weeks, or a
maximum of three, is quite sufficient.} (1. -- {JOURNALIST. So you would play
in ten tournaments a year?! --- CHESS PLAYER. Well, what of it? That is what I
did in the period from 1972 to 1974, and I didn't feel in the least unhappy.})
(1. -- {JOURNALIST. Korchnoi once wrote that to keep in good form he has to
play 80 games a year... --- CHESS PLAYER. I need more. A minimum of 100,
since calculating play requires constant practice, although, strange as it may
seem, I am not a particularly 'calculating' player. --- The first rounds of
the Latvian Championship were spent 'warming up' after a long period of chess
inactivity. I played quietly, with the accent on technique. --- This gave
pleasure neither to me, nor to the fans, and I 'switched styles', after which
I succeeded with several quite attractive attacks.}) *

one point, and by playing on in the last round until there were only the kings
left, I became the Champion of Latvia, regaining this title after a 12-year
interval. --- In the summer came the Candidates Matches. We prepared very
thoroughly for my first opponent, Portisch, who at that time was already
considered an opening specialist, and whose style resembled that of Botvinnik.
Hoping for success, and knowing that the semi-final Matches were due to begin
only a week after the quarter-finals, at the same time we made some
preparations for a match with Ivkov, reckoning that he would win against
Larsen. Our assumption was reinforced by the recent tournament in Zagreb,
where Larsen had lost some five games, including one to Ivkov in about twenty
moves. --- The one thing that we were somewhat guarded about was the shortness
of the matches: 10 games. Up till that time I had played one match of 14 games
with Saigin, and two of up to 24 games with Botvinnik. Perhaps for this reason
my trainer forbade me to play the King's Indian Defence against Portisch, so
as not to take an unnecessary risk, and thus find myself in the position of
having to win one back. We assumed that Portisch would prepare especially
thoroughly against the King's Indian. As White I decided to play only 1 e4,
since against this move the Hungarian Grandmaster defended less confidently.
From the creative point of view, I was quite delighted with these two matches,
against Portisch and Larsen.}) 1-0

{The first match, with Portisch, began with a score of +2 -1 =2 in my favour,
and to some extent set the tone for the whole match. As Black I equalised
fairly quickly, and adjourned the game in a slightly favourable ending.
According to the regulations, adjournments were to be played off after every
two games, and so the second game began with a certain moral advantage on my
side, especially since match play has its own specific form: as White you try
for success, and as Black for equality. --- Here Portisch surprised me: in the
second game, for evidently the first time in his life, he chose the Caro-Kann
Defence. To me, such a blatant copying of Botvinnik seemed somewhat guileless,
and when in my turn I avoided the well beaten path, Portisch found himself in
an unfamiliar situation. He played inaccurately, I played sharply, and the
reader can see for himself how it all turned out. --- On the resumption of the
first game, I missed a win on the 56th move, the last one before the time
control, and then in the third game played badly in an absolutely level
position, overlooked a simple manoeuvre by White, and Portisch played the
remainder of the game very accurately, although it too was unfinished after
the first session. --- The fourth game is also given in this book, and I would
merely like to give the conversation which I had with Portisch when we were
analysing it afterwards. The point is that at some stage I had to choose
between transposing into a technically better, perhaps even won position, with
a knight on d4 against a bishop on d7 and an isolated black pawn at d5, or
playing for an attack. I chose the latter. --- Here Portisch asked me why I
hadn't played differently at this point, with Rd3. I replied that the move
hadn't even entered my head. He looked at me in astonishment, and said that I
had already played this move in an earlier game. It was my turn to be
astonished. 'Where? When?' 'At Curaçao, against Benko!' --- Yes, Portisch had
prepared conscientiously for our match. --- The day finished with a score of
1-1, for straight after this game I resigned the adjournment with a quiet mind
... --- It was perhaps the fifth game that proved decisive. Once again the
Nimzo-Indian Defence, and a variation which was not expected of me: the only
time I had played it previously was in the 1953 USSR Youth Championship. As it
turned out, Portisch was 'in general' prepared for it, and it was he who
surprised me by offering a sacrifice of the exchange. I found the correct
reply, and a sharp ending was reached, in which, towards the time control,
Portisch succeeded in outplaying me. --- Nearly two whole days were devoted to
the analysis of this position. It was published in full in the Riga magazine
'Shakhmaty' - the editorial staff always 'forced' its editor not only to give
directional guidance, but also to write conscientiously about all the events
in which he, that is I, took part. It is not possible to give the full
analysis here, nor is it necessary, and I will limit myself to just the main
line. Portisch sealed} 41. e4 $1 {, the only move to give him any winning
chances. There followed} Rxh2+ 42. Ke3 Bf7 43. Rb6 Rh5 $1 {, and after half an
hour's thought White replied} 44. f5 {, which forced Black from the road of
analysis onto the path of improvisation.} ({What a pity! The game could have
finished beautifully if White had chosen the sharp} 44. e5 fxe5 45. f5 {, with
unequivocal mating threats. After the forced} Rg5 $1 46. Ke4 h5 47. Kxe5 h4 48.

theoretically drawn position is reached, where the rook and pawn cannot win
against the bishop.}) (44. -- {After Portisch's move, the game was drawn
without any particular trouble. Before the last three games I still had a lead
of one point, but the previous game had evidently overtaxed Portisch, for he
played without any great enthusiasm, and I won both as Black in the 7th game,
and as White in the eighth. This gave me the necessary 5½ points ahead of
schedule. --- After a break of a week came the semi-final match. I have
already said that Larsen's victory over Ivkov came as a surprise to us, and
Larsen is the sort of opponent against whom one must either prepare very
carefully, or else play spontaneously. --- In view of the lack of time, the
first variation was ruled out, and we realised that the match was going to
prove very difficult, although the score from previous encounters was clearly
in my favour: +3 -0 =2. --- So, in an optimistic frame of mind, I played the
King's Indian Defence in the first game, with the permission of my second.
This attempt was to be the first and the last. It turned out that Larsen was
very well prepared, and played much more strongly against me than he had
against Uhlmann in the recent Zagreb Tournament. --- He adopted a new, very
interesting order of moves, which set Black extremely complex problems. Then,
however, I was surprised that, instead of deciding the game by combinative
means, Larsen, contrary to his usual habit, played very reservedly, and
practically allowed me to equalise. Here I began to think of more, remembered
the score of our previous encounters, and after missing good drawing chances,
once again got into a lost position. Larsen was once again unhurried, but this
time inexorable. I postponed my resignation until the day the game was resumed.

{The following day the unexpected happened. Larsen decided to play too openly
for a draw. The fact is that there are very many players in the world who can
play for a win, but very few who can draw to order, especially as Black.
Larsen certainly cannot be considered one of them, and the penultimate game of
the Ivkov-Larsen match is a further indication of this. --- What became of
Larsen's desire can be seen from the game, which is given here in the book.
Thus the score became 1-1. Then came two draws, one of which, the 4th game,
affected me badly, and left its mark on my play in the 5th game. --- In the
match with Ivkov, Larsen had adopted the Alekhine Defence in one game, and it
had also occurred in his previous games. In our game, after} 1. e4 Nf6 2. e5
Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 dxe5 {To some extent a Larsen patent.} 5. Nxe5 {, he
suddenly played} Nd7 {. If this had been in a simultaneous display, I would
have decided that my opponent had simply overlooked the stroke} 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7.
Qh5+ {, when, against his will, the black king is forced to go for a walk. ---
Larsen could not have missed this, and I began examining the possible
variations, which were, of course, pretty complicated, Intuition kept telling
me that the sacrifice could not be incorrect. However, I decided to calculate
everything 'as far as mate', studied one variation, a second, a third... 50
minutes went by in this way, and most of the time was spent in searching for a
defence for Larsen, whom I nevertheless trusted. Finally, in one of the
innumerable variations, I naturally succeeded in finding something resembling
a defence. --- Of course, the position did not require such consideration.
Either my opponent's 'offer' should have been immediately declined, or else
the problem should have been tackled without prejudice, and the knight
sacrificed at f7. In fact I rejected the sacrifice after prolonged thought,
and this was a psychological blunder, for even after I had gained the
advantage, my thoughts kept returning to the 'critical' position. Somewhere in
the middle of the game, I suddenly came to the conclusion that in a variation
I had examined, and which I had thought to be in Black's favour, White in fact
gains a decisive advantage. This I could not endure, and I played the second
part of the game aimlessly, which led after 40 moves to a lost ending. Then I
had to seal my move. I thought for over half an hour, I even wanted to resign,
but Larsen was no longer on the stage. --- In a gloomy mood we sat down to
analyse, and began with the position after... Black's 5th move. We convinced
ourselves that 6 Nxf7 would have given White a very strong attack, and went on
to the adjourned position. Considering it to be hopeless, we lazily moved the
pieces about. At about three in the morning, owing to Koblents's extreme
tiredness, I managed to draw a couple of times, and I joked that now Larsen
would be unable to win the ending. Thus a small though, to be honest, rather
dubious degree of optimism arose. --- In addition, however, at some stage play
could transpose into an ending, very slightly similar to the games
Botvinnik-Fischer and Portisch-Tal, where separated pawns successfully fought
against two connected passed pawns in a rook ending. This also gave us a
certain amount of hope. --- Nevertheless, what saved me was no doubt the fact
that Larsen thought that he could win the game just as he pleased. At the
decisive moment Black's eyes were 'dazzled', and when the second time control
was reached at move 56, the position was already drawn.} (7. -- {The game as a
whole somehow unsettled me, and for the fifth game I extracted from my arsenal
the Grünfeld Defence, which I had prepared for the match with Portisch. I have
always liked it in a platonic way, but previously I had played it only a few
times, and with no great success. --- Although, as the game went, I could have
gained equality without difficulty, I once again began dreaming of more, which
finally led to a retreat. On this occasion Larsen demonstrated his technical
ability, and to adjourn the game seemed improper. Thus Larsen went into the
lead. --- On the day before the sixth game, Larsen's wife, who was able to
affect Bent's mood like no one else, left Yugoslavia. Whether it was for this
reason or some other is not clear, but the score was immediately levelled (the
game is given here) and the tension reached breaking point. --- The seventh
was, in my opinion, the most interesting, sharp and fruitful game of the match,
though it was not without its mistakes. Larsen did not gain any opening
advantage, and got into serious time-trouble, in which I became nervous, and
for some unknown reason rejected the win of a piece. Then one of us blundered,
the other returned the compliment, and we adjourned the game, so as to resume
it, according to the schedule, after the 8th game. --- In analysis we found
that, practically by force, an ending could be reached with rook and pawn
against knight and pawn. In Averbakh's book on the endgame, we found exactly
this position, with the diagnosis - draw, and began looking to see how we
could avoid it. Suddenly I thought of an idea by which we might disprove
Averbakh. After long searching we decided that we had managed to do this. ---
This meant that in the three remaining games, in two of which I had the white
pieces, I could play calmly! I adjourned the 8th game with a purely symbolic
advantage, which was impossible to realise, and then resumed the 7th game. It
turned out that, after all, it was not so simple to refute the theoretical
findings, and as a result the score remained level. --- Thus we were back
where we started, and everything depended on the last two games. And if the
score should be 1-1? The seconds and the chief controller, the likeable and
witty Austrian Dorazil, discussed this, for the moment theoretical but
perfectly real possibility. They could not come to an agreement (playing to
the first win was not practised at that time in the Candidates matches, and
first occurred 9 years later in a Ladies' Match) and so Dorazil made the
following suggestion: 'It will all be very simple. I will stand Larsen and Tal
side by side, and give each of them a sheep's bone, and then bring in my dog.
The one he goes up to will go through to the final!!'}) (7. -- {The
controller's decision was 'accepted' with delight, and play continued. --- The
9th game also proved to be dramatic. At the board I found an important
rejoinder to an opening surprise (at least, that is what it was for me) by
Larsen, and by about move 15 already considered that I could play for a win.
In addition, Larsen once again spent a great deal of time in thought. --- Here
nerves came into the act. At first I committed some inaccuracies, and then in
Larsen's time-trouble made such a move that my position immediately became
hopeless. When, after the game, Koblents asked Larsen to comment on the move
24...g5, the Dane replied: 'For several minutes I thought that Tal had gone
mad!' --- Indeed, there is no other word for this move but mad. Larsen
immediately gained a menacing attack, and after the time-scramble and its
inevitable slips, we adjourned the game in an ending which was inferior, and
most probably lost for me. Larsen was a pawn ahead with a good position, and
could do what he liked. --- The one thing that we were able to find in
analysis was a rather simple trap. --- Larsen fell into it! Although the
adventures did not end there, and we both in turn made further mistakes, a
theoretically drawn ending was reached. --- Thus before the last game I had an
advantage not only in the form of the white pieces, but also in that my
spirits were raised. Besides, at that time I had faith in my ability to play
decisive games. --- The reader can see for himself how the battle was decided.
--- I must admit that I returned home in high spirits, although they could
have been dampened by the fact that in the final I had to meet Boris Spassky,
against whom the chess score was far from in my favour.}) (7. -- {JOURNALIST.
Incidentally, which of the Candidates would you have preferred to meet in the
final? --- CHESS PLAYER. If one goes by bare arithmetic, I had a plus score
against Geller and Smyslov. As they had already played each other in the
quarter-finals, the chance of me meeting a 'pleasant' opponent was not all
that high.}) (7. -- {JOURNALIST. You are, after all, of an emotional nature,
but in matches you see before you the same face, day after day... --- CHESS
PLAYER. It is for this reason that even now I prefer tournaments. --- Even if,
in a match, my opponent's face is the most likeable. --- Before describing the
match in Tbilisi, I must 'complain' that my preparations for it were ruined by
medical considerations. The doctors discovered something completely imaginary 
(as it later turned out) in my lungs, and virtually insisted that I should be
sent to the Crimea. In addition, they stated categorically that the match
should take place only in Yalta. I flatly refused to agree to this, since
after a very friendly correspondence with Spassky, I had suggested Tbilisi,
and he had agreed. I have no doubt that Boris would have come to Yalta if I
had asked him to, but to play in a sanatorium... Ugh! --- Prior to the match,
Koblents came to Yalta, along with L. Shamkovich, who also helped me in my
preparations. Occupied with all kinds of medical procedures, I did not spend a
great deal of time at the board. In addition, it was only later that I
realised that all this endless manipulation and swallowing of medicines did
not exactly assist the development of my creative fantasy, or even put me in a
good frame of mind. --- Then the match started. The first game straight away
featured an interesting move by Spassky, for whom the three encounters of 1965,
and the four (including the match with Petrosian) of 1968/9 were to be the
summit of his achievements. --- This glory must rightly be shared with I.
Bondarevsky, an excellent trainer, who not only keenly senses the nuances of a
position, but also the psychological condition of his protégé and the opponent.
--- The interesting 'move' made by Spassky was to play the Marshall Attack in
the Ruy Lopez, and not just this by itself, but also the treatment given to
the attack by Spassky and Bondarevsky: giving up a pawn to avoid a sharp
calculating struggle. --- So, at the very start of the match, Boris gained the
initiative for a pawn, and at the same time a solid position. I attempted to
shake his position, and was successful, although analysis later revealed that
White had in fact played too riskily. I obtained the better ending, and had I
continued to conduct the game strategically I would have had quite good
winning chances. However, a combination with a purely study-like idea cropped
up, and without hesitation I temporarily sacrificed a piece, which, after
Spassky's precise and simple reply, gave me only a useless extra pawn in an
ending with opposite-coloured bishops. --- In the second game Spassky, who
like myself plays less strongly at the beginning of an event, miscalculated in
a sharp position, and came out a pawn down, and I won.}) (7. -- {JOURNALIST. I
have a photograph from the beginning of the third game. Spassky is sitting at
the board, bent low and ready to spring, as it were. He is a picture of
self-discipline, of a man striving to go forward. You are quite placidly
leaning back in your chair... is it possible that the third game, and the
match as a whole, was lost not by a chess player to a chess player, but by an
athlete to an athlete? --- CHESS PLAYER. Very possible! Although it would seem
that psychologically I lost the match somewhat later. --- In the third game,
Spassky avoided the Marshall Attack, for which we had prepared. --- White
should nevertheless have obtained a slight but comfortable and lasting opening
advantage, but I simply played the moves in the wrong order. The game went
into an equal ending, and I offered a draw. It was only after the match that I
found out that Bondarevsky had given Spassky strict instructions to play on in
such positions 'until Tal was sick of them'. The shrewd trainer was right: on
receiving a refusal and after some further 'moving about', I began to create
difficulties for myself, and adjourned the game a pawn down, although the draw
had not yet been thrown away. --- The resumption took place the following day.
Here again Spassky and Bondarevsky chose exactly the same unhurried tactics -
no forced variations! I had not the time left to do this - the previous day I
had used up half an hour on my clock. Here I worked out a long study-like
variation, and reached a position where Spassky would have a king and queen
against my king and a pawn on fl. And I boldly went in for it. But when this
position was just about to be reached, I realised that my king would not be on
g8, which would have given the draw, but on e8, and that when I queened the
pawn I would be mated. I was forced to change course, but for this it was
already too late.}) (7. -- {After the quiet fourth game, before which Spassky
gave me a present - it was played on my birthday - Spassky once again played
the Marshall Attack, committed an inaccuracy, and I obtained by force an
ending which was highly unpleasant for Black. Instead of playing 'a la
Spassky', and gradually realising my extra pawn over a large number of moves,
I was once again tempted by some concrete variations, exchanged all four rooks,
and then realised that in the resulting ending with opposite-coloured bishops
there was no longer a win. --- When, in the sixth game, by utilising one of
his opening weapons, Spassky just as quickly took play into an outwardly
harmless, but in fact slightly favourable ending for White, my nerves once
again could not stand the strain. Instead of equalising accurately, I 'rushed'
things, both of Spassky's rooks penetrated onto the eighth rank and we thought
that the adjourned position was lost. --- The one slim hope was that, if
Spassky had sealed the most natural move, then by a tactical stroke I could
exchange a pair of rooks, and although my position would remain unpleasant,
the draw would be there. --- Strange as it may seem, it was just this move
that Boris sealed! He then 'tormented' me for quite a long time (this followed
from his tactics in the match) but without result. --- Here it was that I made
a mistake. I was advised to avoid 1 e4 for the moment, especially since I had
prepared for many of Spassky's favourite schemes against 1 d4, but I became
obstinate. Besides, I was subconsciously counting on Spassky's former
inability to play decisive games (which had more than once let Boris down),
and I set myself the goal of maintaining the equilibrium until the penultimate
11th game. So, I thought, let him once again play the Marshall Attack, even
though I had not achieved anything against it so far! He played it, and what's
more found an improvement on his previous play, and deliberately took play
into a slightly inferior ending. However, the tactics planned by Spassky and
his trainer justified themselves. I gradually 'converted' the favourable
ending into one that was not altogether comfortable, but on resumption
nevertheless held the draw. --- In the eighth game Boris played slackly, and
Black quickly equalised. Perhaps if there had been two more draws, then
Spassky would have cracked, but it was I who did so first. In the ninth game I
made the half-hearted decision to play 1 e4, but not allow the Marshall Attack.
Boris played inaccurately, and White gained a considerable advantage, but in
striving for the 'planned' fifth point I got carried away. I began to demand
too much from myself, and what is more important, from the position, and
instead of first ensuring the safety of my king, I moved my rook off somewhere
and gave Spassky counterplay which he utilised splendidly. --- As a result the
game was adjourned in a lost position. Acting unhurriedly, and in
exaggeratedly academic fashion, Spassky realised his advantage. --- The
situation had now changed sharply. There were only three games to go to the
finish, in which I would have White in only one, and I had to win back a point.
--- In the tenth game, as early as the 3rd(!) move, Boris demonstrated his
unwillingness to get mixed up in anything at all risky, and instead it was I
who did this. --- I played unevenly, and badly, and the score became 6-4 in
Spassky's favour. --- As Spassky later told me, before the eleventh game, and
also during it, he was very nervous, but this did not prevent him from playing
his best game of the match. I organised a typical football 'pile-up' on the
black king's position, but gave up as lost the queenside and the centre. This
neglect of prophylaxis did not go unpunished, and the match concluded. ---
After this I went to see the Tbilisi doctors, where I found out that, firstly,
intense doses of all sorts of medicine do not go unnoticed either by the
kidneys or by the nerves, and secondly, that I was, according to the doctors,
perfectly healthy! I could only regret that the discussion between the
physicians from Riga and Tbilisi, which concluded in a victory for the latter
and for me, had not taken place a few months earlier.}) *

{I will not hide the fact that before the start of this game I was nervous.
The last time I had taken part in the Latvian Championship was seven years
previously, since when I had had practically no encounters at the chessboard
with our best players. Meanwhile, the class of their play had markedly risen.
It is not just a joke that in 1958 many participants were trying to reach the
candidate master norm, whereas now the norm had been set for obtaining the
title of master. One of the seekers of this title happened to be my opponent
in the first round. --- Of course, my participation in the Championship of the
Republic was purely for training purposes, in particular for working on my
opening repertoire and on the question of 'time'. Many observers criticised me
(and not without reason) for the fact that sometimes I play too quickly, and
at other times with the speed of an express tortoise. --- In the Championship
of the Republic I took the advice of D. Bronstein: to note down the time taken
over each move during the game. I think that this additional information can
help disclose the course of the players' thoughts during the game.} 1. c4 {(0.
01) --- It is curious, but until 1963 I was not such an ardent supporter of
the move 1 e4. After the Petrosian-Botvinnik match, on which I had to
commentate, I took to commencing all my games (apart from two it seems) in
this way, perhaps as a protest against the fact that for two months 1 e4 was
not once played. However, to be honest, in two years one can become tired of
this also.} (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7.

1. e4 c6 {Strange as it may seem, an unexpected reply, since the Hungarian
champion adopts this defence very rarely, and we (more precisely, I) had
somehow not thought up any plans against the Caro-Kann. It was clear that the
Hungarians would have carefully studied the games from my matches with
Botvinnik, and therefore, without any prepared 'mines', it would be
inexpedient to choose the variations with 7 h4 (2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Bf5
5 Ng3 Bg6 6 N1e2 Nf6) or 4 h4 (3 e5 Bf5). After Portisch's first move I
feverishly began to recall which variations I had not yet adopted in
tournaments. To my aid came reminiscences as a trainer. Last year in the USSR
Ladies' Championship I assisted Zara Nakhimovskaya, and since the Riga lady,
in answer to 1 e4, plays only l...c6, we studied the various systems of the
Caro-Kann literally for a whole day. As it happened, Konoplyeva chose the line
2 Nc3 d5 3 Nf3. From the opening Nakhimovskaya obtained an excellent position,
but all the time I felt that somewhere White could have played better 
(although, of course, I did not mention this to Zara). It was now that I
remembered this. In the end, I decided, Portisch has played less games with
the Caro-Kann than Nakhimovskaya (I hope that they will both excuse me for
this comparison).} 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 {A slight, but rather well-known
inaccuracy.} (3... Bg4 {has long been considered best here, not yielding White

the following reaction.}) 15. c4 $5 {This looks like a blunder - after the

rather unusual material balance. White has a queen and three pawns against a
rook and two minor pieces. If Black succeeds in coordinating his forces, then
he will clearly have the better chances. There are two factors which hinder
this: the audacious pawn on a7, which at the very least frightens Black, and,
although only temporary, the difficulty of developing his king's rook. With
his next move Portisch tries to solve these two problems simultaneously, but
the further course of the game shows that his plan is incorrect.} Ke7 ({The

uncomfortable. This White succeeds in doing.}) ({Therefore, stronger was the
straightforward} 22... g6 {. How the game would have finished in this case, I
do not know, but at the board it seemed to me that the pawn on a7 insures
White, to a significant degree, against defeat. In a number of variations he
is able, by playing a8Q, to win in exchange both Black's remaining queenside
pawns.}) 23. b4 $1 {Evidently Portisch underestimated this reply. Since it is
clear that capturing the pawn is bad because of 24 Rb1, Black is forced to
allow it on further, and its advance spreads confusion in the enemy ranks.} Ra8
