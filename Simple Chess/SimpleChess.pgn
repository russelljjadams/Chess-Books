1.b4 {A space-gaining move. The center is fixed and White does not want to advance on the Kingside for fear of exposing his own monarch, so the logical zone for expansion is on the Queenside.} 1...Bb6 2.a4 Rfd8 {Black dare not hit back with13 .. a5 because of 14.

Nf5 followed by Ne6 and as trying to get a grip on c5 or d4. Black's difficulties stem from the fact that he has no good outpost for his pieces. Interesting to note that a5 is the computers top choice and the only move that keeps relative equality.} 4.Be2 {In contrast Botvinnik's advance has given him a nice square on c4 which he can occupy with either a Knight or a Bishop.} 4...c5?? {Two question marks for a move which does not actually lose any material may seem a bit harsh, but I want to emphasize the point that before 15...c5 Black merely had problems, but now he is lost.} 5.b5! {Why Is Black lost? Material is equal and White hasn't got a piece beyond the second rate. The answer lies in the Pawns. White has two beautiful squares on c4 and d5, plus a mobile Pawn roller on the left flank, whereas Black's Pawns constrict his own pieces terribly, parocularly the Bishop. Botvinnik now treats us to a vigorous exhibition of technical chess as he converts these advantages into a win.} 5...Ne8 6.Nc4 Nd6 7.Bg5! {A surprise tactical shot, but its aims are positional.} 7...f6 {The point of the combination.

Being rather less self-indulgent, Botvinnik contents himself with one preparatory King move before embarking on the winning process On general principles. his King will feel safer on a White square.} 16...Qd7 17.Qe2 Ng6 18.Bb3 {At last an attack, but there's no need for any excitement. The outcome is a mere formality. With a Bishop having the mobility of a tortoise with rheumatism, Black Is In no position to offer any real resistance.} 18...Ne7 19.Qc4 h6 20.Qf7 Kh7 {31... Qxb5 loses a piece to 32. Qf8+ Kh7 33. Qxd8 Qxb3 34.

For the moment, however, I merely want to draw your attention to the effortless simplicity with which Botvinnik established and drove home his advantage. With the possible exception of 18. Bg5!, none of his moves could in any way be described as surprising or difficult to visualize, They were al! really rather obvious. So why cannot everybody play like that? Well, they can providing they recognize and understand the importance of structure. The most important single feature of a chess position Is the activity of the pieces. This is absolutely fundamental in all phases of the game opening, middlegame and especially endgame, a theme which I hope will become increasingly apparent as the book progresses. The primary constraint on piece's activity is the Pawn structure. Just as a building is constructed around a framework of iron girders, a chess game is built around an underlying Structure of pawns. The difference lies in the fact that the iron framework is fixed, whereas the chessplayer has a certain amount of flexibility with his Pawns.}  1-0

1.-- {The job of the chessplayer must therefore be to use his skill to create a Pawn set-up which will allow his own pieces the optimum freedom and stability, while denying his opponent's similar scope. This is the problem of structure, which will be dealt with in some depth.  To take an example, let us go back to the position of Diagram 2 and examine it from a structural point of view. Removing the pieces from the board, but leaving the pawns, we have Diagram 3. From this we see very strong squares or outposts for his pieces on c4 and d5. They are strong because neither can be challenged by a Black Pawn. In contrast, Black has no outposts at all. So arithmetically speaking White had a 2-0 lead in outposts, a very healthy state of affairs. Bearing this in mind, notice the vital role played by the White Pawn on c3 guarding Black's natural outpost on d4. If White were ever to play the positionally abysmal c4 he would not only give Black his long awaited outpost, but would also smother his own c4 square, thus equalizing the outpost score to 1 - 1 at a stroke. Moreover the damage would be irreversible. Pawns cannot move backwards. If you inadvertently put a piece on a bad square, you can always retract it at the cost of some time  (and face) , but in the case of a Pawn you are lumbered with it for the rest of the game. Think twice about Pawn moves, especially in the center.}  *

In most cases these two effects  (weak squares, weak Pawns)  go hand in hand, as we shall see, For the moment, here is a game in which White uses the presence of weak Pawns In the enemy camp to tie down the Black pieces and so launch a mating attack, despite the absence of Queens.} 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.O-O f6 6.d4 Bg4 7.dxe5 Qxd1 8.Rxd1 fxe5 9.Rd3 Bd6 10.Nbd2 Nf6 11.Nc4 Bxf3 12.gxf3 O-O-O {The position is tense.

1.-- {White has an outpost on e5, but Ne5 can always be met by Nxe5 and after recapturing with the Pawn, his Outpost is gone.

{In the previous chapter we looked at Pawn structure from the point of view of outposts and how an outpost acts as a pivot, about which the pieces can swing Into action. Without such an outpost as foundation, pieces tend to lack the stability necessary for a successful assault and are liable to be driven back in confusion. It Is sheer folly to try to attack directly a well coordinated and developed position. Many players underestimate the defensive resources Inherent in such positions and will in game after game bash their heads against a brick wall instead of using their heads to first weaken the cement. The point they repeatedly fail to appreciate is that a very definite superiority In force is needed to ensure that an attack will be successful. This superiority can take either one of two forms:  (i)  Better development. This Is simply a case of superiority In numbers. the aggressor being able to feed more pieces into the attack than the defender has available to fight them off.  Ii  Better coordination. This is a much more subtle form of advantage which one must work hard to build up. The idea is to disarm the defense by first tying its pieces down to the defense of certain point, so that when the storm does break they have very little scope or opportunity to react. Here we concern ourselves primarily with the second condition. Outposts provide the necessary stability for the attacker, but something must also be done to destroy the defender's coordination. This is where the second aspect of Pawn structure, weak Pawns, comes in. If the defending forces can be reduced to the menial task of protecting Pawns, they will not he able to offer much opposition to a full-scale offensive. So what exactly is a weak Pawn and how is it recognizable? The answer is both Simple and logical. A weak Pawn is one which cannot be protected by another Pawn and so requires support from its own pieces. Note that the criterion is the ability to be protected by another Pawn, not the existence of such protection. Take the example of two adjacent Pawns on, say, d4 and e4. Neither protects the other but each has the ability to be guarded by the other, by advancing. We must therefore say that the weakness or strength of two adjacent Pawns depends on whether or not they are able to advance if the necessity arises.  The position given gives us an example of adjacent Pawns  (d6, c6)  which are very definitely weak, because neither can move, d5 is never feasible, as it leaves the e Pawn in the soup after the reply exd5  (note for this purpose the power of the White Rook on e1, while c5 leaves Black riddled with holes. The continuation of the game Hecht-Forintos illustrates well the combination of outpost play)} ({f5}) { (and the exploitation of weak Pawns.)} 1.Bg5 {A simple developing move which exerts great pressure on the Black Pawns. White has many threats to win a Pawn, including the spectacular 2. Nxe5} 1...Rfd8 {Black has no choice but to defend passively. If he tries to iron out his weaknesses with 1...Bxg5 2. Nxg5 d5, he merely tees himself up for the knockout punch, viz. 3. Qh5 h6, and now White can win spectacularly by 4. Nxh6+ gxh6 S. Qxh6 Rfe8 forced 6. Re3! with a winning attack for the piece, or settle for the methodical 4. Nxf7 Qxf7 5. Qxg6! Qxg6 6. Ne7+ Kh7 7. Nxg6 Kxg6 8. exd5 winning a Pawn. Although White cannot hope to achieve success by a direct Kingside attack, Black's frantic attempts to cover up his weaknesses could well set something up for him.} (1...Bxg5 2.Nxg5 Rad8 { this continuation seems fine for Black, Stockfish agrees} (2...d5 3.Qh5 h6 4.Nxh6+ (4.Nxf7 Qxf7 5.Qxg6 Qxg6 6.Ne7+ Kh7 7.Nxg6 Kxg6 8.exd5) gxh6 5.Qxh6 Rfe8 (5...Be8 6.Re3 { Black is better in this line, the book text and analysis is wrong.}) 6.Re3 { It's true that the line given in the text is winning for White but Rfe8 isn't forced and the best move is Be8.})) 2.Rc1 {Turning the focus of attention to the c Pawn he threatens to win it by capturing twice on e7, while preserving the harmony of the White position.} 2...Rac8 3.Rc3! {A multipurpose move illustrating clearly the maleffects of weak Pawns. White creates options to double on the c file with Qc2. double on the d file Rd3 or possibly transfer the Rook to g3 at some later date. Black has no opportunity to reciprocate, but must on every move be prepared to meet each contingency. We see a definite rift between the mobility of the two armies opening up. When the gap becomes wide enough White will be able to bludgeon his way through the Black position without encountering much resistance.} 3...Bxg5 4.Nxg5 Nf4 5.g3 Bh5 {If 5...Ne6, 6.

1.e4 {The most common form of Pawn weakness encountered in practical play is the isolated Pawn-one which has lost its neighbors and stands alone in face of the enemy. Such a Pawn has two basic deficiencies: firstly it requires defense, and secondly the squares immediately in front of it make ideal outposts for the other player. To see in more tangible terms what this means, let us look at a famous game Fischer won on his road to the World Championship against an ex-World Champion Tigran Petrosian.} 1...c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.O-O d5 8.c4 {Black has built up a very solid-looking Pawn center, but only at the cost of neglecting his development. Fischer uses the lime he has gained, not to launch any violent offensive Black's position is quite solid enough to absorb anything like that, but to break up the Black center before its pieces have the chance to support it. A Pawn center must be adequately supported by pieces to be effective, else it merely becomes a target to attack.} 8...Nf6 {Under no circumstances can Black consider recapturing away from d5, as this would leave him with 'split' Pawns on a6, c6 whose weakness would plague him for the rest of the game. A plausible alternative was 8...d4, trying to keep the center closed, but yet another non-developing move must be regarded with some suspicion.} 9.cxd5 (9.Qa4 Bd7 10.e5 c5 11.Qd1 dxc4 12.Bxc4) 9...cxd5 10.exd5 {I'm confused as to why Fischer played cxd5 and exd5, when Qa4 was much better as Black isn't under obligation to take with the e Pawn. He can take with the Queen, which the author completely ignores. So does Petrosian apparently but Qxd5 is the best move, exd5 does give the advantage to Fischer. Ideally Black. would prefer to recapture with the Knight, but after the reply 11. Be4! he would in the long run be unable to avoid the isolation of his Pawn owing to the pin on the diagonal. Having successfully saddled Black with two isolated Pawns, Fischer now gives us a perfect lesson in how to go about taking full advantage of them.} 10...exd5 (10...Nxd5 { Knight takes seems fine, too. I don't really understand why Petrosian willing accepted an isolated Pawn when he had two options that kept the game equal.} 11.Be4 Bb7) 11.Nc3 Be7 12.Qa4+! {Author gives this an exclamation point but I'm not so sure it was that great of a move. A deep move. Given time to castle, play Bb7 and d4, Black would be very happy. Remember, weak Pawns are only a handicap if they result in lhe pieces being driven to bad or passive squares in order to defend them. Now however. 12 ... Bd7 13. Qd4 gives the White Queen a dominating view of the world while leaving the Black pieces hemmed in behind the d Pawn. Rather than submit to this, Petrosian sets a cunning trap.} 12...Qd7 (12...Bd7 13.Qd4) 13.Re1 {Fischer does not allow his vision to be blurred by a lust for materialism. He could win the exchange by 13. Bb5 axb5 14. Qxa8, but after 14...0-0, ...Bb7 and ...d4 Black's whole position suddenly springs to life and White finds himself in trouble. Always be wary of grabbing material at the cost of the coordination of your pieces.} (13.Bb5 axb5 14.Qxa8 O-O) 13...Qxa4 14.Nxa4 Be6 15.Be3 O-O {A convenient time to stop and reassess the situation. The exchange of Queens has helped White somewhat, in that Without Queens less can happen to interrupt or obscure the basic flow of the game. Nevertheless White's overall strategy remains unchanged. He must use the weakness of the two isolated Pawns to tie down the Black pieces while maximizing the activity of his Own.} 16.Bc5 {One of the secrets of endgame play is to realize which pieces to exchange, which to retain. Here White wants to trade off the Black·squared Bishops for two reasons: i As the weak Pawns stand on White squares, the Black-squared Bishop is the only piece which cannot be tied down to their defense. ii White wants to use the c5 square as an outpost for his Knight.} 16...Rfe8 17.Bxe7 Rxe7 18.b4 {The next logical step in the chain. Having just traded the 'right' pair of Bishops, he does not want the Black Pawns to run away onto Black squares, for in that case he will have traded the wrong Bishops! Now White can always meet ...a5 with b5 and the massive passed Pawn must prove decisive. This process of fixing weaknesses on squares where they are most readily assailable is particularly common and should always be borne in mind when playing against weak Pawns. It is also worth noting that b4 establishes the outpost on c5. Whether you approach the position from the point of view of outposts or weaknesses, the move 18. b4! cries out to be played.} 18...Kf8 {In endgames the King is a very powerful piece and should be used as such. The immediate value of this move Is to unpin the Bishop, but in the longer term Black would like to bring his King to d6 from where it would probably cement his position together.} (18...Rb7 19.a3) 19.Nc5 Bc8 20.f3 {White also needs to use his King. Despite the fact that each of his pieces is more actively placed than its opposite number there is no immediate way to break through, so the King must be used to increase the pressure. Mistaken would be 20. Rxe7 Kxe7 21. Re1+ Kd6 when Black can probably hold the position. It is important not to allow the Black King across the e file. Once on the Queenside it can to some extent release the pieces from their task of defending Pawns for more active service.} (20.h4 Nd7) 20...Rea7 {A very curious move, but its motivation is worth closer study. There are no points in the White position to coumer attack, so Black must seek some method of 'improving' his own position. The obvious try is to bring the King to d6, but the only available route Ke8, Kd8, Kc7, Kd6 is both long and hazardous. The other possibility is to transfer the Bishop to a more active defensive post. At the moment the Bishop effectively defends the a Pawn, but plays no further part in the game, other than interfering with the Rooks' coordination and generally getting in the way. It could fulfill its duties much more effidently from b5, but the problem is how to get there. The normal try would be 20 ... Nd7 21. Nb3 exchanges help the defense 22, Bf1 Bd7 intending Bb5 on the next turn. At this point however the weakness of the d Pawn takes its toll, for after 23. Red1 not 23. Rad1 Bb5 24. Rxd5? Nxf3+! Black must abandon his plan in order to save the Pawn. Petrosian's move has the same idea Bd7, Bb5 in mind.} (20...Bd7) 21.Re5 Bd7 22.Nxd7+ {A slightly surprising decision in that one would not normally want to trade such a dominating Knight for a struggling Bishop, but here the exchange enables Fischer to penetrate with his Rooks. It is really a question of trading one advantage superior minor piece for another superior Rooks.} 22...Rxd7 23.Rc1 Rd6 {To try to free the other Rook from the defense of the a Pawn.} 24.Rc7 Nd7 25.Re2 g6 {Black has been totally starved of constructive moves. Let us examine the position in detail to see why: a If the Knight moves, there comes Ree7 winning. b King moves also allow Re7. c If Black tried to trade off his passive Rook with 25 .. Re8, White would complete the tying-up process by 26. Rxe8+ Kxe8 27. Ra7 Nb8 28. b5! There are other ways to win, but this is the neatest 28 ... axb5 29. Bxb5+ Kf8 29 ...

White simply blockades the d Pawn with his King and Queens the a Pawn. d Obviously the Rook on d6 cannot move. e 2S ... a5 26. Bb5 N moves 27. Ree7 etc. The necessity to guard two isolated Pawns has reduced Black to Pawn moves alone. White now only has to add one more weight, namely his King, and the scales must tip.} (25...Re8 26.Rxe8+ Kxe8 27.Ra7 Nb8 28.b5 axb5 29.Bxb5+ Nd7 (29...Kf8 30.Rb7 Rd8 31.Kf2) 30.Kf2 Kd8 31.Bxd7 Rxd7 32.Rxd7+ Kxd7 33.Ke3 Kd6 34.Kd4) 26.Kf2 h5 27.f4 {With the idea Kg3, Kh4, Kg5 and f5.} 27...h4 28.Kf3 f5 29.Ke3 {The King has been denied an entrance on the Kingside, but the chessboard is a big place. There is plenty of room on the other side.} 29...d4+ {Naturally Kd4 must be prevented.} 30.Kd2 Nb6 {Rather than wait for the King to ooze in, Petrosian makes a final bid for some counterplay. Purely passive defense would lose to, inter alia, the plan of Bc4. Kd3 and Re6.} 31.Ree7 Nd5 32.Rf7+ Ke8 33.Rb7 Nxf4 34.Bc4 {A quaint final position which shows the immense power of even a small coordinated force. Despite having a Pawn more, Black is quite helpless in face of the threat of Rg7 and Rg8 mate. E.g. 34...g5 35. Rg7 Rf6 35...Ng6 36. Bf7+ 36. Rg8+ Rf8 37 Bf7 +. A truly classic game, one worth continual restudy. It shows with perfect simplicity all the steps necessary to transform a superior Pawn structure into a win. The one underlying theme running through the whole game is the way the Black pieces are systematically deprived of all mobility.}  1-0

To keep the position blocked. The White BishOps are badly hemmed in by their own Pawns and without prospect of ever breaking out. We have here a new source of 'weakness'. White's Pawns are bad not so much because they require defense, but simply because they get in the way. In Some sense one can think of them being weak because the pieces cannot avoid defending them.} 17.Rb1 Bd7 18.Rb2 Rb8 19.Rbf2 Qe7 20.Bc2 {White has already run out of constructive ideas.

Black is not doubling White's f Pawns in order to attack them, but to create an outpost for his Knight on d4. The quartet of Pawns on f2, f3, g3, h2 in itself forms a very strong Pawn complex, but the metamorphosis of White's e Pawn into an f Pawn means that he can no longer control his d4 square. We can see exactly the same idea in a game Karpov-Browne, San Antonio 1972, which opened 1. c4 c5 2. b3!? Nf6 3. Bb2 g6?! 4. Bxf6! exf6 5. Nc3 and White has a beautiful outpost on d5.

If you look back at variation I you will see that Black ran into trouble on the d file, despite having first option on it. So where did he go wrong? Firstly, he failed to appreciate 66 the disparity in strength between the Bishops. The White Bishop was able in variation i to drive the Black Rooks off the d file singlehandedly, and in variation ii enabled White to open the a file for his own Rooks. In both cases the Black Bishop was a spectator. And secondly, Black had no reason to occupy the d file anyway. Occupation of an open file is of no value unless there is a chance of penetration. Here the White King prevents any possible insurgence on the d file. In particular the entry square on the seventh rank, invariably the most important, is also guarded by lhe White Bishop, making the d tile an entirely prospectless avenue for Black.

1.e4 {It must be stressed that open files only have value as a means of feeding Rooks  (or possible Queens)  into the enemy position, so that a file has no value unless there is somewhere along it an entry point, i.e. an advanced point on whtch a Rook can safely land. The ideal entry point is on the seventh rank or the second rank  (i.e. d7 or d2 on the d file, etc.)  . Every Rook secretly dreams of landing on the seventh or second ranks, making a 90-degrce right  (or left)  turn and eating its way through the enemy lines. There is something magical about the number seven for a While Rook. Alternatively, points of entry on the eighth, Sixth, or even fifth rank can be just as effective. But there must be one, otherwise the file is useless. In this respect the King can play an important role. In the endgame, there is no piece better equipped to defend entry points than the King. For example, a King on e2 simultaneously covers three entry squares on the d file  (dl, d2 and d3) , a feat which no other piece  (apart from the Queen of course)  can perform. This makes the location of the opposing King a vital factor in assessing the value of an open file in the endgame. The basic rule is the further from the King, the better. Returning to our example, we can see that the d me was not a useful commodity for Black because of the proximity of the White King, yet the very same file was potentially lethal in White's hands as the Black King was far away. We can see this principle operating in the following variation of the Sicilian Defense, the so-called Maroczy Bind:} 1...c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Nxd4 7.Qxd4 d6 8.Be3 Bg7 9.f3 O-O 10.Qd2 Be6 11.Rc1 Qa5 12.Nd5 Qxd2+ 13.Kxd2 {Theory assesses this position as very favorable for White. Why? Because the c file is going to be opened and the White King is much closer than the Black one. As a result White is able to take control.} 13...Bxd5 {There is no choice but to take the Knight, and 13 .. Nxd5 14. cxd5 Bd7 15. Rc7 is immediately decisive, so the text move is forced.} 14.cxd5 Rfc8 {Everything seems okay with Black, as 15. Rxc8+ Rxc8 16. Bxa7 achieves nothing in view of 16 ...

White intends to drive the enemy Rook off the file with Bh3. He Is only able to employ this strategy of conceding the open file, then playing to regain it, because the Black Rook has no point of entry.

1.Na4 {The minor pieces play a major role in determining who controls open files. The side with the more active minor pieces can generally count on gaining access to any files that may open up. This is basically what happened in our previous examples. Naturally, outposts too have their part to play. This is better illustrated by Diagram 37 than by words alone.  The main features of the position are an open c me and a White outpost on b6. The latter enables White to wIn the file in a very straightforward manner: 1. Na4 Rac8 2. Nb6 Rxc1 3. Rxc1 Rb8  (what else?)  4. Rc7 Ne8  (what else?)  5. Rd7 and Black has been totally run out of moves. The winning process for White is to centralize his King and then win the d Pawn with Nc4. In the meantime Black has only waiting moves at his disposal.  Chess is very much a team game. The pieces rely heavily all each other's help and cooperation, so jf one does not pull its weight it lets the whole side down. If you look back you w:ill see that in no example so far has one side lost out on a file because his Rooks were badly placed. In each case the team has been dragged down by the inability of some Bishop or Knight to match its opposite number. There Is an old chess maxim: 'If one piece is bad, the whole position Is bad: How true. Maybe this will explain why there is so much talk of Bishops, Knights and Kings  (alas no cabbages!)  in a chapter on open files.} 1...Rac8 2.Nb6 Rxc1 3.Rxc1 Rb8 4.Rc7 Ne8 5.Rd7  1-0

1.d4 {The open file is a double·edged weapon. Although a way to feed the major pieces into the heart of the opponent's position, there is always the danger of it being seized and used to reciprocal effect by the enemy. In short, it is a twoway road for Rooks. The chessplayer, not being an unselfish advocate of equality of opportunity, naturally prefers a oneway system. The half-open file is precisely this. We do not have to go very far  (three moves to be exact)  to find an example of one: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. cxd5 exd5.} 1...d5 2.c4 e6 3.cxd5 exd5 {White has the half-open c file, Black the half-open e file. So what does this mean? Cannot Black always erect a granite wall on the c file by c6 and White do Similarly on the e file by c3? Yes of course, but the point is that the Black Pawn chain b7, c6, d5 can by challenged by White with b4 and b5. When b5 comes, there is no way Black can avoid being left with a weak Pawn. If he captures away from c6, the d Pawn is left isolated, while allowing an exchange on c6 will leave the c Pawn backward. These are the simple mechanics of the minority attack. It is no more nor less than a method of weakening an otherwise sound Pawn set-up by advancing Pawns at it. The process is quite long and slow, the payoff at the end relatively small one weak Pawn to aim at, two maybe if you are lucky, but its value is undeniable. Moreover, it cannot easily rebound on you. An open file can change hands, a half-open file cannot. Indeed it cannot even be challenged. Imagine the contortions Black would have to go through to oppose Rooks on the c me in front of his Pawns in a position akin to that of Diagram 43. Out of the question. The minority attack has a certain inevitability about it. Though cumbersome, once the mighty wheels have been set in motion, the opposition has no way to apply the brakes. So much for extolling the virtues of half-open files, but going to Diagram 43 we see that Black has the e file. Surely, he too can launch a minority attack in due course? Not so easy. A minority attack on the e file would involve advancing his f and g Pawns. But where is he to put his King? Certainly not on he Queenside in the path of White's attack. On the other hand it is not the height of expediency to castle Kingside and then send your Kingside Pawns scampering off into the distance to create just one weak Pawn in the enemy camp. The final reward is simply not worth the risk. In general one cannot afford to mount a minority attack in front of a castled King. These attacks only usually work on the other side of the board. Let us look at a couple of examples of play from Diagram 43 to see how the minority attacks work out in practice.} *

1.-- {Another typical Sicilian Pawn structure. Black has the half-open c file, White the d file. Each has an associated outpost, White on d5, Black on c4. Outpost is something of a misnomer here, for as you may remember an outpost was originally defined as a square that could not be challenged by an enemy Pawn. Here Black can play e6 and White b3 challenging the respective outposts, but only at a cost. b3 weakens the c3 square and so makes the c Pawn more difficult to defend. Correspondingly, e6 weakens the Black d Pawn, so these moves can only be made in exceptional circumstances. The squares d5 and c4 are therefore effectively outposts, if not technically so.  These considerations explain a couple of points about the Sicilian Defense that may have been puzzling you:  (i)  Why does Black so often develop his f8 Bishop passively with e6 and Be7 when he can give it a beautiful diagonal by g6 and Bg7? Because e6 and Be7 deprive White of his d5 outpost without leaving the d Pawn too weak. After g6 and Bb7 Black can rarely consider e6 as well.  Ii  Why Is the Maroczy Bind  (Pawns on e4 and c4)  considered so effective for White against the Sicilian? Because with a White Pawn on c4 Black can have no outpost there. and Black can generate very little play on the c file.  Strategical problems are born in the opening, which Is why it is so important to understand the openings you play. Hopefully this chapter has given you some insight Into the workings of the Sicilian Defense and related openings as well as the minority attack.}  1/2-1/2
