{ Before the start of the last round of the 2020 Russian Championship, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Sergey Karjakin were sharing the lead with 7 out of 10. Nepo made a quick draw against Maxim Chigaev and all eyes were now on the game between Daniil Dubov and Sergey Karjakin. Would Dubov be able to create any chances against Karjakin, the 'Minister of Defence'?  Dubov played amasterpiece that many will remember for the spectacular queen sacrifice on move 19. Karjakin had just played 18... Be6 and now Dubov played the 'move of the year' 19. Qxg6!!  Dubov sacrifices his queen for two minor pieces, a passed pawn, and a menacing attack on Black's king. Karjakin resigned on move 38, which handed Nepomniachtchi the 2020 Russian Championship title.  Few people will remember the novel opening that Dubov used to create these chances. It was the first time that this opening was used at the highest level and another example of the creative and inspiring play of Dubov.  The subject of this course is the position that arises after the moves: }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. b4
{ Dubov suggested to his coach Sasha Riazantsev that this would be an amusing line for a blitz game. His coach took it to the next level and provided some deep analysis that made it suitable for over-the-board play at the highest level. Dubov's assessment of the variation is:  'All in all, the line looks decent for White; I don't see a way for Black to get an advantage, which is quite something for such a sharp position.'  The goal of the opening is to pursue dynamic, unbalanced positions where Black is under immediate pressure. White often sacrifices a pawn in exchange for an attack, an advanced passed pawn, more space, and a lead in development. The main lines are quite forced and thus better preparation and a better understanding of the imbalances, in combination with superior calculation will win you the game.  For this mini-course I used the article Dubov's Challenge by IM Yuriy Krykun in New In Chess Yearbook 138  (2021)   and the analysis by Daniil Dubov of his game against Sergey Karjakin for New In Chess Magazine 2021 #1. In addition, I consulted the Hiarcs Openings Book, the Lichess games database, the ChessBase Mega Database, and Correspondence Database, and engine analysis  (Stockfish 14, Leela Chess Zero, and Komodo Dragon 2)  .  I selected and prioritized theChapter 2. Variations based on the Lichess games database  (online games, both rapid and classical, across all ratings)  . The course was created with club players in mind. The first variation in the mini-course is the variation that you are most likely to get! The mini-course includes typical mistakes of club players and shows how to refute them. I deliberately kept the book small  (about 15 variations)  . It is enough for me, as a titled player, to play the opening with confidence over the board and has proven sufficient to beat 2400+ players online.   I often give the Stockfish 14 evaluation of a certain position. For many club players, it is hard to gauge how big an advantage is when the material is equal. My recommendation is that when Stockfish evaluates a position as significantly better and you don't understand why that you open an Analysis Board in Chessable and play a few human moves for the Black side to see how play develops. This way you get a feel of how to build an attack against a vulnerable king, how to cash in a passed pawn or how to exploit a badly placed piece.  Chapter 3. Puzzles is meant to reinforce key motifs and tactical themes. You have to find the best move: sometimes it is a tactic and sometimes it is the strongest move. The number of stars * in front of the puzzle indicates the difficulty of the puzzle.   I appreciate any questions or feedback you might have. They will only help make the mini-course only clearer and better!  The mini-course is complimentary to my Evans Gambit - Beginner's Guide and Scotch Gambit - Modern Attack - Beginner's Guide. The course is a great alternative to the Evans Gambit with many of the same themes as in the Evans Gambit and the Scotch Gambit. }

{ This section provides information on general opening principles and the first moves of Dubov's Giuoco Forte.   As a trainer in the Steps Method I teach my students the following basic opening principles  (3 Golden Rules)  :      Pawns in the centre  The pawns provide space and support for your own pieces and limit the activity of your opponent's pieces.     Develop your pieces  Develop your pieces towards the middle of the board where they can be as active as possible and support the pawns in controlling the centre. Good cooperation between the pieces adds to the overall activity of your pieces. Develop your knights and bishops first and, in general, the queen last. The queen is the most valuable piece and you can lose time when she gets chased by minor pieces.    Bring your king into safety  The king is vulnerable in the middle of the board and can come easily under attack on the e-file or through an attack on the vulnerable squares f2 and f7. A castled king is much safer. 
  Complete your development by bringing all your pieces into the game. Find a good square for your queen and connect your rooks.  The side that completes his opening most effectively can start attacking first.   A good metaphor to use for your pieces is an 'army'. During your game constantly ask yourself: Is my next move adding maximum energy to my forces? Are all soldiers engaged? Are they working well together? Are any team members vulnerable?   These are guiding principles. Under the influence of chess engines, play has become more concrete. Opening principles can be violated in specific circumstances based on concrete analysis with 3,600 rated engines. }
1. e4
{ The pawn on e4 controls d5 and f5  (important squares on the opponent's half of the board that Black can no longer occupy with his pieces)  .   After 1. e4, the bishop on f1 and the queen on d1 can enter the game. }
1... e5
{ The most popular moves after 1.e4 are 1... e5  (42%)  , 1... c5  (25%)  and 1... e6  (11%)  .   1... e5 is the symmetrical response leading to less immediate tension and combat than 1... c5  (Sicilian)  . After 1.e4, White threatens to play 2.d4, which would give White a strong grip of the centre. Both 1... e5 and 1... c5 prevent White from controlling the centre with 2 pawns. }
2. Nf3
{ Developing the knight towards the centre and attacking the pawn on e5. } 2...
Nc6
{ With this move, Black protects the pawn on  e5  . Please note that if Black chooses  2...Nf6  to maintain the symmetry, he will never reach complete equality because White will always have the first-move advantage and at a certain moment Black will not be able to continue to copy White's moves, for instance in the case of a check. }
3. Bc4
{ 3. Bb5 @@StartBracket@@Ruy Lopez@@EndBracket@@ was by far the most popular choice of masters. This started to change after Kramnik used the Ruy Lopez - Berlin Defence to defeat Kasparov in the World Championship match in 2000 and was reinforced by analysis with the strongest engines in recent years.   3.Bb5  Nf6  4.O-O  Nxe4  5.d4  Nd6  6.Bxc6  dxc6  7.dxe5  Nf5  8.Qxd8+  Kxd8  The queens are off, Black has the bishop pair and White has a better pawn structure. Practice has shown this to be very solid for Black.   The Marshall Attack is the second reason why White players have switched from 3.Bb5 to 3.Bc4  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  Be7  6.Re1  b5  7.Bb3  O-O  8.c3  d5  9.exd5  Nxd5  10.Nxe5  Nxe5  11.Rxe5  c6=âˆž  Black will continue Bd6-Qh4 and often Bg4-Rae8-f5 and Black's attack and active bishop pair compensate for the one pawn deficit. }
3... Bc5
{ The main alternative is  3...Nf6  on which I recommend:  4.d4  exd4  5.e5  See my course the Scotch Gambit - Modern Attack.   The main alternative for 4. d4 is 4. Ng5  3...Nf6  4.Ng5  d5  5.exd5  Na5  6.Bb5+  c6  7.dxc6  bxc6  8.Bd3  Nd5  9.Nf3  Bd6  Black's pawn structure might be damaged and Na5 out of play, but I never liked playing against the piece activity of Black.   Some players choose for 4. Ng5 just hoping that their opponent blunders into the so-called Fried Liver Attack  3...Nf6  4.Ng5  d5  5.exd5  Nxd5?  6.Nxf7  Kxf7  7.Qf3+  Ke6  8.Nc3  Ncb4  9.O-O  c6  11.d4  Nxc2  12.dxe5  Nxa1  13.Rd1+- }
4. c3
{ White wants to occupy the centre with d4 and take back with a pawn on d4 after exd4.   After  4.b4  we enter the Evans Gambit, an opening on which I also wrote amini-course. This opening was successfully played in classical games by world champions Kasparov, Fischer, Morphy and lesser Gods like Nakamura and Short. White sacrifices material in exchange for a lead in development and more space often leading to an attack on Black's king.  4...Bxb4  5.c3  Ba5  6.d4  exd4  7.O-O    The understanding of the trade-off between material, development and space is critical in chess. When players start out playing chess, they are often focused on the material balance only. They keep score using the values: pawn =1; knight=3; bishop=3, rook=5 and queen= 9 to 10 with a bonus for the bishop pair of 0.5. These values depend a lot on the activity of the piece. Kasparov taught us that a stable knight on the 6th rank, a so-called Octopus, is worth at least a rook.   At the start of this introduction, I suggested using army as a metaphor for your chess pieces. It is not surprising that with more space and a lead in development your army is more active and thus more forceful.  Kaufman concluded that if White has two extra moves at the start of the game @@StartBracket@@e4 and d4@@EndBracket@@ that Black is lost! So after 1.e4 Nc6 2. d4 Nb8, Black can already resign! Material is equal but Black lacks space and is behind in development. This also implies that Black has to be very careful not to waste any time in developing his pieces. }
4... Nf6
{ Black continues to develop, Nf6 attacks the pawn on e4 and Black is now ready to castle and bring his king into safety. He allows the move d4 by White as Black will counter with d5 shortly thereafter.   The move  4...d6?!  gives White the centre he is aiming for after  5.d4  exd4  6.cxd4  Bb4+   Or  6...Bb6  7.Bb5  Bd7  8.Nc3  White controls the centre and is slightly better.  7.Nc3  Bg4  8.O-O  Nf6  9.Nd5+-  White threatens Bg5, pinning Nf6 and threatening to destroy Black's pawn structure, and after  9...Nxd5  10.exd5  Ne7  Black loses Bb4 after  11.Qa4  with a double attack on Ke8 and Bb4.   Even worse is  4...h6?  5.b4  Bb6  6.b5  Na5  7.Bxf7+  Kxf7  8.Nxe5+  and White has a winning advantage. }
5. d4
{ By playing this move White now attacks the Bishop on  c5  and the pawn on  e5  . On the other hand, this move does not protect the undefended pawn on  e4  .  Top players prefer  5.d3  d6  6.O-O  O-O  followed by Nb1-d2-f1-g3 with the idea of occupying f5 and attacking the Black king. 5. d4 is considered too direct to gain an advantage because of the line given after 6. cxd4. See below. }
5... exd4
{ 5...Bd6  is the only way to protect the pawn on e5 but is a bad move: Black has difficulty completing his development, Bd6 has very limited activity. Stockfish 14 evaluates this position already as +2. }
6. b4
{ There are 1.2 million games in the Lichess database with 3... Bc5. Only 2,200 feature 6. b4!? i.e. 0.2% or 1 in 500 games. This opening has a strong surprise factor and the lines are very poisonous!  White puts Black under immediate pressure by attacking Black's bishop and will subsequently attack Nf6 with the pawn advance e4-e5. White's play is logical and easy to memorize.  Most frequently, Black retreats his bishop to b6 after which Bg5 attacking Qd8 becomes a theme.     In the mainline  6...Bb6  7.e5  d5  8.exf6  dxc4  9.Qe2  Be6  10.b5  Na5  11.fxg7  , White gets an advanced passed pawn on  g7  .  White aims to secure his pawn with Bg5-f6 and Bg5 also prevents Black's king from castling long. Black's king is often subject to a direct attack.     The most popular move played by White on move 6 is  6.cxd4  Bb4+  7.Bd2  Bxd2+  8.Nbxd2  d5!  Black does not allow White to keep his centre majority  9.exd5  Nxd5  with equality. }

{ Before we go into the woods of the variations, let's spend one moment to look at this line from Black's perspective. Instead of looking 'inside-out', we will be looking 'outside-in'! Dubov's Giuoco Forte is a rarely played variation so which line will Black likely use as his reference? }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. e5
{ This is the start of the Giuoco Piano - Anderssen variation.  It was used from time to time by Evgeny Sveshnikov and most recently by Wesley So. Let's compare the position with the mainline of the Dubov's Giuoco Forte after 7. e5.    Giuoco Piano - Anderssen variation     Dubov's Giuoco Forte   We have the same position with the moves b4 and Bb6 inserted in the mainline of Dubov's Giuoco Forte.  What are the main differences  (the variations are replayable further below)  :  1. In the Giuoco Piano, Black's knight is trapped after 6... Ne4 7. Bd5.  In Dubov's Giuoco Forte, Black can save his knight by taking on c3. 6. b4 Bb6 7. e5 Ne4 8. Bd5 Nxc3    2. The insertion of the move b4 makes Ra1 more vulnerable to a potential attack with Bd4, which is an important factor after 6... Ng4.   In the Giuoco Piano Black's is much worse after 6... Ng4 7. cxd4 and White controls the center and threatens h3-Nh6-Bxh6.  In Dubov's Giuoco Forte, Black can play 6. b4 Bb6 7. e5 Ng4 8. 8.cxd4?! Nxd4! 9.Nxd4 d5 10.Be2 Nxf2 11.Kxf2 Qh4+ 12.g3 Qxd4+ 13.Qxd4 Bxd4+ and Black wins.  With the pawn on b2, Ra1 would not be under attack.  3. In Dubov's Giuoco Forte, White can play b5 chasing the knight on c6. The knight on c6 controls the crucial squares d4 and e5. This makes in the Dubov's Giuoco Forte the variation 8. exf6 dxc4 9. Qe2+ Be6 10. b5 Na5 11. fxg7 Rg8 12. Nxd4 feasible.   In the standard Giuoco Piano this line is not possible as Nc6 controls d4.    Replayable Dubov's Giuoco Forte variations:   6.b4  Bb6  7.e5  d5   7...Ne4  8.Bd5  Nxc3  9.Nxc3  dxc3   7...Ng4  8.cxd4?!  Nxd4!  9.Nxd4  d5  10.Be2?  Nxf2-+  11.Kxf2  Qh4+  12.g3  Qxd4+  13.Qxd4  Bxd4+-+  8.exf6  dxc4  9.Qe2+  Be6  10.b5  Na5  11.fxg7  Rg8  12.Nxd4  threatening Nxe6. Most Black players take twice on  d4  , but that allows White to activate his bishop to  b2  and protect the pawn on  g7  .  In the Giuoco Piano the only good reply against 6. e5 is 6... d5. It does not come as a surprise that in  Dubov's Giuoco Forte ,  7... d5 is by far the most popular choice by Black. }
6... d5
{ 6...Ne4  7.Bd5  Trapping the knight.  7...Nxf2  8.Kxf2  dxc3+  9.Kg3  cxb2  10.Bxb2Â±  Black has 3 pawns for a piece and White's king is unsafe, but this is not enough. White will play h3-Kh2 bringing his king into safety and use his active piece to attack the Black king. SF14:+2   6...Ng4  7.cxd4  Bb4+   7...Nxd4?!  8.Nxd4  d5  9.Be2  Nxf2  10.Kxf2  Qh4+  11.g3  Qxd4+  12.Qxd4  Bxd4+  13.Kg2Â±  Bd4 is not attacking Ra1 as the pawn is still on  b2  .  8.Nc3+-  White is much better SF14:+3. After  8...d5  White maintains the tension with  9.Bb5  . The knight on  g4  is vulnerable and White threatens to damage Black's pawn structure after h3-Nh6-Bxh6 }
7. Bb5
{ 7.exf6  dxc4  and Black is better as White is missing the b4-b5 push to destabilize Nc6.  8.Qe2  Be6  9.fxg7  Rg8  SF14:-4 White does not have Nxd4 as Nc6 is protecting  d4  . }
7... Ne4 8. cxd4 Bb6
{ The Anderssen-variation is  8...Bb4+  9.Bd2  Nxd2  10.Nbxd2  O-O  with a slight pull for White. Most recently only the move 8... Bb6 is being played by top GMs.   The comparison between the standard Giuoco Piano and Dubov's Giuoco Forte has taught us that most Black players will choose for 6... Bb6 and 7... d5 as these are the best replies in the standard Giuoco Piano.  This is confirmed by the games in the Lichess database with the move 6... Bb6 being the choice in 78% of the games after 6. b4, and 7... d5 being the choice in 45% of the games after 7. e5. }

6... Bb6
{ The move 6... Bb6 is played in 78% of the games with 6... Be7 a distant second at 14%. The remaining 8% are for clearly worse moves, like 6... Bd6 and 6... Nxb4.     6...Bd6?  7.O-O  O-O  8.b5  Na5  9.Bd3Â±  White threatens e4-e5 forking Bd6 and Nf6. It is hard for Black to complete his development.   6...Nxb4?  Black gets three pawns for a knight but it is not enough. White has a huge lead in development and is the first to attack.  7.cxb4  Bxb4+  8.Bd2  Bxd2+  9.Nbxd2  c5  10.O-O  O-O  11.Qb3  d6  12.e5  SF14:+3  When the bishop retreats to e7, the disadvantage for Black is that the bishop is less active than on b6 and not fighting for the control of the centre. The advantage is that the move protects the h4-d8 diagonal  (White can not attack Qd8 with Bg5)  . Black claims that White overextended himself with the pawn pushes b5 and e5 and Be7 can get quickly back into the game.   After  6...Be7  7.e5  the moves  7...Ng4  and  7...Ne4  are equally popular.   6...Be7  7.e5  Ng4  8.cxd4  Bxb4  9.Bd2  Bxd2  10.Qxd2  is a solid line for Black.  'White's centre seems rather impressive, but he is a pawn down and Black is about to undermine the centre with d7-d6. However, the g4-knight is very misplaced and White is more active at the moment. I think that after a sequence of careful moves the position peters out into equality.' IM Yurily Krykun, New In Chess YearBook 138 - 2021   6...Be7  7.e5  Ne4  8.b5  Na5  9.Bd3  Nxc3  10.Nxc3  dxc3  11.Qa4  b6  12.O-O  with equality. Note that Black can not castle immediately as  12...O-O  fails to the double attack  13.Qe4  attacking both Ra8 and h7. White will continue to exert pressure with Qe4 or Qg4. }
7. e5
{ White asks Black the next question: How to defend Nf6 against e5? Black's options are a counterattack in the centre  (d5)  , move away  (Ne4 or Ng4)  or pinning the attacker  (Qe7)  .  Most played are now:  7... d5  45% 7... Ne4 20% 7... Ng4 17% 7... Qe7 13%   (Lichess Rapid and Classical - all ratings) }

{ White asks Black a third question: How to defend against bxc6? Black's main options are: d3  (counterattack on the queen)  and Na5 or Nb4  (moving away)  . }
10... d3
{ A natural reaction  (played in 72% of the games after 10. b5)  to secure the passed pawn and create a threat on the queen. But this move activates the queen after she moves to e4, from where the queen also eyes h7. Better is 10... Na5  (played in 17% of the games)  or the rarely played 10... Nb4  (Anand's choice)  .     10...Na5  played in 17% of the games  11.fxg7  Rg8  12.Nxd4  Bxd4  13.cxd4  Qxd4?

Taking the Qd3 would give the badly placed knight on a5 the square c4. See mymodel game - SF14:+3   10...Nb4  is played in 2% of the games after 10. b5 and was the choice of Viswanathan Anand in hisgame against chess sponsor Oleg Skvortsov in the ZÃ¼rich Chess Challenge. Black sacrifices a piece for two passed pawns and an active bishop pair. The resulting position is very unbalanced. I recommend the following continuation  11.cxb4  Qxf6  12.O-O  O-O  13.a4 }
11. Qe4 { Black's knight on c6 is still under attack and has to move now. }

13... Qd5 14. Qxh7 { Do not trade pieces when you are attacking. } 14... Kd7
15. O-O
{ Note the lack of space of the Black king and queen. To illustrate the threat, imagine White could play two moves in this position: Re1-Ne5+ The Black king can not go to the back rank because of Qxg8 and has to move to d6 where it can be attacked by Bg5-f4 of by Nbd2-e4.   The Black queen also just has the square d6 if White is allowed to play after Re1-Re5.   In addition, Na5 is still out of play and Rg8 is occupied with preventing the promotion of pawn g7.    The following line highlights the weakness of e5 and f6 if Black tries to untangle himself with natural moves   15...Rae8  to connect the rooks and prepare Kc8  16.Nbd2  Kc8  17.Rae1  Qxb5  to allow the knight to come back into the game via Na5-Nc6.  18.Re5  Qd7  19.Ne4  SF14: +8!  Stockfish 14 evaluates the position after 15.O-O as +3 for White. }

White's strategies:   Attack the Black king taking advantage of the lead in development and the half-open h-file   Use the extra piece to win back pawns and then convert the material advantage    My recommendation is that you practice this position against a BOT  (like Maia on Lichess)  to learn how to convert White's initiative despite his material deficit.

{ Christopher Yoo, now 15, became an International Master at the age of 12. This game was played at the US National Open in Las Vegas in June 2021. So also prodigies endorse this opening!  This game illustrates perfectly the type of fight you can expect with this variation.

18. Bf6 { Defending the pawn on g7. } 18... Nxa1 19. Rxa1 Kc8
{ Black has played a perfect game so far. Black is an exchange up and has been able to bring his king into safety and finish his development. White's protected passed pawn on g7 gives him sufficient compensation for the exchange. White has seven pawns and Black six. White's pawn on b5 is under attack. White can take on c4 with Nd2. If Black takes the knight on c4, then White takes the bishop on f5 with check. A dynamic balance. White chooses now a suboptimal continuation, but Black does not spot the surprising tactic. }
20. h4
{ A strong idea but it allows for a crazy combination. It was better to play directly  20.Nxc4  Qxc4  21.Qxf5+  Qe6  22.Qg5  and White plans to follow up with h4-h5-h6. }
