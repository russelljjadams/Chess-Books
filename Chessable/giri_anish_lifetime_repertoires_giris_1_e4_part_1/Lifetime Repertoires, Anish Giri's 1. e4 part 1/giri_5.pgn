1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 { The move  3.d4!?  was recently brought back into fashion thanks to many interesting new discoveries. It is one of the main tests against the Petroff Defense.   One advantage of  3.d4  over the classical main move  3.Nxe5  is that many Petroff players still consider the latter to be the main move. } 3... Nxe4 4. Bd3 d5 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6. Nc3 { This system has gained in popularity quite a lot recently. I first noticed it before there have been many fresh high-level games, particularly, because I noticed the computers favoring White a lot, which was surprising, given that White ruins his queenside pawn structure for no immediately obvious benefits.  A while after that a few model games have been played, such as Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov and everyone has realized that there is quite some strategic danger for Black, in these positions.  The idea is that White wants to get rid of the strong e4-knight and the doubled c-pawns will do a decent job at stopping counterplay in the center and the queenside.  White, on the other hand, thanks to our pawn on e5 @@StartBracket@@after ...Nxe5 dxe5@@EndBracket@@ and a kingside majority, has good chances to develop play on the kingside.   I will examine three different concepts for Black here:  • Black taking both the knights,   • Black taking the e5-knight, but not the c3-knight:  6...Nxe5  7.dxe5  Bb4  ,   • Black taking the c3-knight, but not the e5-knight:  6...Nxc3  7.bxc3  Bd6  or  7...c5  . } 6... Nxe5 7. dxe5 Nxc3 8. bxc3 { Previously, this is how the games would go: Black would try to block the e5-pawn with ...Be6, get the ...f7-f5-push in, hoping that this would neutralize White's kingside majority and there would be nothing to worry about.  It turned out, however, that the strong protected passed e5-pawn gives White more space and a long-term edge, while Black's queenside pawns are targets and his lack of space as well as lack of counterplay makes the position very unpleasant and hard to play.  We will see how this manifests itself in concrete variations in this chapter, but also in the model games, where we can see how White can eventually break through this optically solid position that Black has. } 8... Bc5 { The more active move, compared to  8...Be7  , and the one that is preferred by Petroff theoreticians like Dominguez and Vidit.  Now we will likely end up trading the bishops with an eventual Be3 and this extra trade will bring Black some relief, though not necessarily the full equality. } 9.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 { The so-called Philidor Defense, the one in which Black for some reason chooses to guard his e5-pawn not by developing a light piece with  2...Nc6  , but with a pawn.

Nxd4 { Taking with the queen is pretty sound as well, as ...Nc6 can be met with Bb5:  4.Qxd4  Nc6  Bb5  .   The traditional  4.Nxd4  capture is more ambitious, though. } 4... Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 { This is the way to go, though some strong players, mainly Mamedyarov, have experimented with the fianchetto  5...g6?!  . } 6. Bf4 { The most ambitious setup. We go Qd2 and O-O-O next and go for the kill.  The plans with O-O are quite harmless I believe and is exactly what Black is hoping for when going for this solid but surprisingly robust setup. } 6... O-O 7. Qd2 { Black has 4 ways of trying to generate counterplay and here at Chessable, we take all of them seriously. } 7... Nc6 { The main line and likely the best move as well. Before starting his queenside pawn storm, Black wants to get rid of the strong d4-knight and finish his queenside development. Still, it seems that White is faster. } 8. O-O-O Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Be6 { At least Black has finished his development. } 10. f3 { I wanted to be smart and recommend the rare and fancy  10.Be2!?  , which is liked by the engines as well, but after checking out the old main line with  10.f3  , I didn't really see why we have to deviate from the trodden paths.   10.Be2!?  is definitely worth investigating as well.  10...a6  11.Qe3  Threatening e4-e5 on the way.  11...Nd7  12.g4  And White has good attacking prospects.

Now that Black is fully developed, this pawn avalanche is looking well-timed. Still, we have our own pawns as well. } 11. g4 { Both sides push the pawns towards the enemy king's shelter. } 11... b5 12. h4 { Preparing g4-g5. } 12... c5 13.

We will have to play it anyway. } 16... c4 17. g5 { Now we start our play, while Black doesn't have an easy way to continue on the queenside. } 17... Rfc8 { It is hard for Black to set up any queenside play, but he can certainly try. } 18. Rh2 { Another important move in our defense. The rook guards the c2-square and ensures that there is no enemy invasion. } 18... a5 { Intending ...Ra6-Rc6, trying to break through on the c-file after all. } 19.
