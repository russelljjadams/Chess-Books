Ba7 { This is an interesting move order, Black swaps the order of ...Ba7 and ...h6 and we will do the same with d4 and Bb3, transposing to the 8...h6 9.d4 Ba7 10. Bb3 line. } 9. Bb3 { Besides my recommended  9.Bb3!?  , there is also the principled move  9.Na3!?  , which was tried by Nepo against Grischuk, though unsuccessfully. } 9... Ne7 { Rerouting the knight to g6 is always a move we can expect. Here Black doesn't get the best of versions of the ...d5-break later on, because he had spent two tempi on safeguarding his c5-bishop with ...a5 and ...Ba7, instead of ...Bb6 in one go.  Still, Black is not doing too badly, and he can try to use the space on the queenside, gained with ...a5, to his advantage.   9...h6  is possibly the best move, but it allows  10.d4  with a direct transposition to 8...h6 9. d4 Ba7 10.Bb3. } 10. d4 Ng6 11. Nbd2 { We should go for this setup, followed by Bc2+Nf1-Ng3. In some cases, in these ...Ne7-Ng6 setups, White tries to get Be3+Nbd2, but here we are just not in time, with the e4-pawn hanging. } 11... Re8 12. Bc2 { Black is at a crossroad. He would ideally try to prepare ...d5, but he can also abandon that plan and go for queenside expansion with ...b5 or ...Bd7+a4. } 12... Bd7 { Developing a bishop, but mainly hinting at ...a4. } 13. Nf1 { If we started with  13.a4  which I believe is less accurate, then Black has a typical resource to stop our desired Nf1-Ng3 rerouting:  13...Bc6!  . Once that happens, it becomes a very weird waiting game, with both sides having no real useful moves.  Instead, I propose to reroute the knight to g3. The main purpose of that is to allow the c1-bishop to breathe and live a healthy life. } 13... a4 { If Black can't or doesn't want to go for the simplifying ...d5-push, the second-best thing he can do in a position like this, is grab some space on the queenside, to at least somewhat compensate for the lack of space in the center.  What usually happens, when Black manages to push his pawn to a4, is that we will get rid of it by pushing b3 or b4, but then Black gets to trade a pair of pawns and also most likely a pair of rooks on the queenside, which will very much help his cause, as the side with less space wants to trade as much as possible.  Still, even after all of that, we do have better control of the center, so we should keep a small plus. } 14. Ng3 h6 { Always useful. } 15. Be3 b5 { White has a choice, to start with  16.b4  or with  16.Qd2  . } 16. b4 { Similar is  16.Qd2  c5  17.b4  axb3  18.axb3  with a small plus thanks to better central positions, but not much more than that, as Black got to trade a pair of pawns and will also trade rooks along the a-file. } 16... axb3 17. axb3 Bb6 { Pushing ...c5 before moving the bishop from the x-ray along the a-file feels somewhat awkward. } 18. b4 { Stopping ...c5 doesn't really win us the game, as Black's position is still very solid and he has traded down a little bit.  Still, I like this move and our prospects. We oversee the situation in the center and can hint at some kingside play with Qd2+Bxh6/Nf5 ideas in the air, potentially.  For now, we just want to make sure our center is stable. } *

The reason I didn't make this move our main recommendation is that Black has a lot of sidelines on the way and frankly, it would just be too unpractical for us, to delve deep into so many branches, when there is an alternative that is in the spirit of this course and is a lot fresher and dangerous as well. } 9...

Black develops more modestly here, going for a passive but very solid setup.  It occurs quite a bit across all levels and even at the very top, from time to time, it shows up. Recently, it has been played a lot by Daniil Dubov and before him Richard Rapport, not to mention that even Magnus Carlsen has used this system occasionally. } 5. O-O O-O { Black can also start with  5...d6  , this move order is testing our basic understanding of the Italian structures and creates a thematic position threat of ...Na5.  6.a4   This is the right move order, as  6.Nc3  allows  6...Na5  .  6...O-O  What else?  7.Nc3  transposes to @@StartFEN@@r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 5@@EndFEN@@  5...O-O  6.Nc3  d6  7.a4  . } 6. Nc3 { The old main line is  6.Re1  , but these days it is also trendy to develop the knight here.  I think the main reason why the Nc3-setup is more promising here than against the ...Bc5-setups is that the situation around the d4-square control is quite different.  With the bishop not being on c5, ...Nd4 is not on the cards and at the same time, White can gain further control over the d4-square with an h3+Be3-setup. } 6... d6 { There doesn't appear to be any point in postponing the ...d6-push.   The move  6...h6  is not too bad, but with ...d6 happening next, it will just transpose back into 6...d6 after  7.a4  d6  - see 6...d6 7.a4 h6. } 7. a4 { White needs to address the threat of ...Na5.   I had played  7.a3  , which is similar, but finally, I chose to recommend this push, grabbing more space on the queenside.  This is a huge tabia, as Black has a lot of different ideas and move orders here. } 7... h6 { I propose to not allow that and respond with a more thought-out option than the automatic 8.h3. } 8. Bd2 { This is a new idea, but it definitely makes sense.   For starters, we are ready to meet  8...Be6  with  9.Nd5!  and there no longer is ...Nb4 after  9...Bxd5  10.exd5  .   Also including  8.a5  a6  is an idea and only then  9.Bd2  , but I like inviting the option of @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/P1B1P3/2NP1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 8@@EndFEN@@  8...Na5  9.Ba2  c5?!  . } 8... Be6 { ...Be6 is a typical idea in this line, but here it is less attractive, now that Black doesn't have a clear response against  9.Nd5  . } 9. Nd5 { Now with  9...Bxd5  10.exd5  Nb4  not being a possibility, Black doesn't have a good active response. } 9... Re8 { A solid way to proceed, but this passive setup isn't likely to fully equalize. } 10. a5 { It's also possible to start with  10.Re1  . } 10... Nb8 { Not an obvious move at all, but a very clever one. Black hints at a ...Nxd5 possibility, so we should clarify the matters. } 11. Nxf6+ { I think it is more practical to keep the relatively bad dark-squared bishop on the board and trade the knights. } 11... Bxf6 12. Bxe6 { Another trade. } 12... Rxe6 13. c4 { Grabbing space. We have more space on the queenside and slightly more active pieces. White has a small edge, with b2-b4 next.  Don't forget to play some slow moves later on, like g3+Kg2, to further depress the opponent, who will struggle to find active ideas. } *
