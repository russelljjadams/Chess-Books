1. e4 e5 { The idea of a complete repertoire for White is not new and having done a few massive courses on Chessable for the black pieces I realized it was now the right time for me to do one.  My vision for the Lifetime Repertoire for White was to give you something that could actually last you a lifetime. I believe the concrete moves down the long variations are replaceable and possible to update, but the framework of the whole repertoire had to be healthy and ambitious enough so that there is that room for the replacements and the updates.  My idea is that if one of the suggestions I give, somewhere on move 20 can be neutralized, there would be room for you to deviate for your next game while staying within the same repertoire and still being able to use the ideas and concepts that I am going to be sharing here.   For that, I felt the Italian is the perfect weapon against the ever solid @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  Nc6  systems.    This course is the first part of the complete 1.e4 repertoire, covers all the options for Black after 1...e5, which is Black's main and most challenging response against our 1.e4. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 { This being a Lifetime Repertoire, I also discuss all possible and impossible gambits and oddities @@StartBracket@@to the extent that  2...d5?  and even  2...Qe7?  are covered@@EndBracket@@ and also, obviously, the more respectable openings, such as the Philidor,  2...d6  , and the Petroff,  2...Nf6  , are covered.   Against the Petroff, I recommend 3.d4!? which I believe to be the most challenging way to play against this ever-solid opening.  2...Nf6  3.d4   I believe the Petroff players still take this move less seriously than  3.Nxe5  , something that they will certainly regret once they face us.  3...Nxe4  4.Bd3  d5  5.Nxe5  Nd7  6.Nc3!  This is the system I advocate against the main line of the Petroff. The pawn structure becomes very imbalanced right away and a world of strategic nuances awaits you in the chapters dedicated to the Petroff. } 3. Bc4 { The Italian, though at this point it is not yet clear, whether we go for something forcing or the fundamental Italian, which is what I recommend.  The fundamental Italian is experiencing a renaissance already for quite a few years and there are two reasons for that - the negative one and the positive one.   The negative reason is that the Spanish  3.Bb5  , which has been the way to go at the highest level for decades, started experiencing serious issues.   Besides the infamous Berlin  3.Bb5  Nf6  , theory also started expanding in all sorts of directions:   • The Open Spanish  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  Nxe4   • and the Archangelsk  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  b5  6.Bb3  Bb7  are more alive than ever.   • The Marshall  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  Be7  6.Re1  b5  7.Bb3  O-O  8.c3  d5  has also never left.    While the Spanish remains a critical way to go, at this point players are often wondering what exactly they are hoping for when placing the bishop on b5, as all of Black's options are equally repelling.  The positive reason, on the other hand, is that it turned out that while the greatest theoreticians have been banging their heads against the Spanish wall, the Italian, which has been neglected, offers at the very least just as large a scope of ideas.  As the engines got stronger, around five years ago, there has been a major reassessment of many positions and positional factors that we encounter in the Italian. It turned out that places where people used to stop their analysis, were just the starting points. In some openings, having the space advantage in the center was overrated, while it was underrated in others. That pointless-looking queenside expansions can have a long-term effect on the rest of the board and that the pawn structure should not be taken out of context as piece activity is often a more important factor.  On a broader scale, the turning point was the humbling realization that the top chess players, the trendsetters, don't know everything about the opening theory and that we all have a lot to learn from the computer, more than we could have previously imagined. That 'it looks fine' is no longer a good point to stop the analysis if the engine is screaming numbers.  The humility and the open-mindedness are what has pushed the top players towards the fundamental Italian and in this course, I will try to give you a taste for the kind of strategic depth and tactical possibilities the opening has to offer. } 3... Bc5 { 3...Nf6  This allows  4.Ng5  , which many fear, but that is more of a one-trick pony @@StartBracket@@pun intended@@EndBracket@@, compared to  4.d3  , as I believe once Black prepares for these forced lines, it is relatively easy to neutralize, as the scope of our possibilities is significantly smaller down those lines.   Against us, though, the  3...Nf6  move order is more flexible, but many of the players who go for ...Bc5-setups will play  3...Bc5  already here.   3...Nf6  4.d3  Here I obviously cover all of the options. Besides the ...Bc5-setup, there is the more modest and solid 4...Be7, but also the trendy fianchetto systems with ...h7-h6+g7-g5 and ...h7-h6+g7-g6.  The sidelines like the risky 4...d5 are also covered of course! } 4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 { Followed by 6.O-O is the core of our repertoire.  Our setup is then somewhat dependent on our opponent’s choice, but in the long run, in many of the systems, we will eventually prepare the central push d3-d4. Conceptually speaking, the idea is to prepare and mobilize and then once fully ready go for the clash in the center. I believe this is a good way to play chess. } *

O-O 6. O-O d5 { This is perhaps the most principled attempt at equalizing against our venomous Italian. Black wants to occupy the center, using the fact that White himself has chosen a slower plan of not going for the quick d3-d4.  This ambitious plan of Black, however, also has some significant drawbacks: the ...d7-d5-break costs a tempo, the knight on d5 will be temporarily exposed and the e5-pawn is now a target, with the rook being able to hit it along the semi-open e-file.

Re1 { The most popular, natural and in my opinion also the most testing of the options.   Alternatively, the cunning move  8.a4!?  is also a venomous one. } 8... Be6 { This has once been played by Anand against Kramnik in a rapid game.   The trick is that the e5-pawn is not actually hanging because after  9.Nxe5?  Nxe5  10.Rxe5  there is  10...Bxf2+!  11.Kxf2  Qf6+!  ,  which is a common theme in these positions. In fact, the threat is stronger than the execution so we just keep our eyes on the e5-pawn and continue developing. } 9. Nbd2 { White reinforces the Nxe5 threat. The same ...Qf6+ trick would no longer work because of Nf3, protecting the rook on e5:   9...--  10.Nxe5  Nxe5  11.Rxe5  Bxf2+??  12.Kxf2  Qf6+  13.Nf3+-  . } 9... Bd6 10. a4 { A very clever improvement on Kramnik's play. White's development scheme in this structure is generally Ne4, b2-b4, a2-a4 and a4-a5, grabbing space on the queenside and while Kramnik started with the natural Ne4 followed by b2-b4, the computer comes up with a much more sophisticated move order.  If we start with a4-a5 first, we create a nasty threat of Qb3 @@StartBracket@@as the ...Na5! idea is dealt with@@EndBracket@@ and after Black protects against it with a useless move like ...Rb8, only then do we proceed with Ne4 and b2-b4, gaining that small tempo on the way. Very nice! } 10... Re8 11. a5 { Now that ...Na5 is prevented, Qb3 is a real threat. } 11... Rb8 { A useless move, in general, but here it was necessary to guard the b7-pawn against Qb3. } 12. Ne4 { Now we proceed with the standard development scheme. The knight not only is active on the e4-square, but it also guards the c3-pawn, so our b-pawn can advance. } 12... h6 { Black has to prevent Ng5. } 13. b4 a6 { Stopping White's expansion, but the deadlock that we have established on the queenside is to our advantage. In the long term, the b7-pawn is weak, and Black's queenside is cramped. } 14. Qb3 { Upping the pressure. } 14... Nf6 15. Be3 { We have finished our development comfortably. Black can simplify, but he can't equalize. } 15... Nxe4 { This trade is not solving the issue of the inferiority of Black's queenside pawn structure and the bad c6-knight. } 16. dxe4 Bxc4 17. Qxc4 { This is one kind of position we are often aiming for in the slow Italian. Although there is some symmetry, all the minor imbalances in the position are in White's favor. We have a better bishop, a better knight and a better pawn structure on the queenside.  Next up we want to slightly improve our kingside with g2-g3+Kg2 and perhaps double on the d-file, before taking further actions. Also, the f3-knight is always ready to embark on journeys, usually via d2 to c4 or b3-c5. } *

Nbd2 { Starting with this move is smarter than including  9.h3  Bh5  first.   It is visible in the line with 9...Bb6: the same sequence of moves wouldn't work with  9.h3  Bh5  included because of  10.Nbd2  Bb6  11.a4  a5  12.Ne4  f6  13.d4  exd4  14.Qb3  when Black has  14...Bf7=  . } 9... Nb6 { A typical move in this variation. Black removes the vulnerable d5-knight with a tempo. Now it is a big moment for White. } 10. h3 { First we include this push, kicking the bishop away to h5, which is where we want the bishop to be in this particular line @@StartBracket@@note that we waited with this h3-push, until Black has shown his cards with 9...Nb6@@EndBracket@@. } 10... Bh5 { The retreat is the most natural and is the way they play. } 11. Bb3 { This was an epic idea first shown to me by my teammate Jorden van Foreest. It turns out that capturing the d3-pawn leads to some complications and more importantly, these complications seem to lead to unpleasant positions for Black.  By now there are a few dozen high-level games on this topic and there is still no consensus on how exactly Black is supposed to neutralize White's initiative. First Black has to choose, to capture the pawn or not to. } 11... Qxd3 { Capturing the pawn is the most direct way to go. } 12. Nxe5 { The complications are clearly about to start. Black is once again facing a tough choice: does he want to sit it out in a worse endgame after  12...Bxd1  , retreat with  12...Qf5  or try his luck with the crazy-looking  12...Qg3  ?. } 12... Qf5 { The best move. The queen simply defends the h5-bishop and also hits the f2-pawn, forcing White to retreat. } 13. Nef3 { We have traded our central pawns and Black appears to be doing quite well, but suddenly there is a very unpleasant threat of g2-g4. Black has a choice, mainly between allowing it and sacrificing on g4 or go into hiding. } 13... Rad8 { The most played move. It is doing a good job preparing a piece sac on g4, but unlike  13...Rfe8  and  13...Rae8  , it doesn't force the g4-push, as we have a good alternative in  @@StartFEN@@3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/1nn5/2b2q1b/8/1BP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 14@@EndFEN@@  14.Qe2  . } 14. Qe2 { After  14.g4  Bxg4  15.hxg4  Qxg4+  16.Kh1  Qh3+  17.Nh2  Bd6!  18.f4  Bxf4  Black already regained 3 pawns and still has a very active position - a better version of 13...Rfe8/13...Rae8 lines. White is able to reach a roughly equal endgame after  19.Re2  followed by Qf1 and the game Michalik-Shirov was drawn.   14.Qe2!  is more testing. White grabs control over the e-file and reinforces the threat of g2-g4, as well as Ne4!?. } 14... Qc8 { A very logical and popular retreat. Black walks out of g2-g4 and prepares ...Rfe8.   Weaker is  14...Qd7?!  as after  15.Ne4!  Rfe8  there is  16.Nxc5!  hitting that queen. } 15. Ne4 { I believe this move has not yet exhausted its resources, but Magnus Carlsen played the clever  15.Qb5!?  Nd7  16.Nh4!  a6  17.Qf1!  and posed problems to Wesley So.   Black should play  17...g5!  according to the engines,  but it wasn't surprising to see Wesley play the human  17...Be7  only to end up worse after  18.Nf5!  .   After  15.Ne4  Black is at a crossroads. He can play the natural  15...Rfe8  , but also  15...Rde8!?  has its points, keeping f7 better protected. Other than that, there is the simple  15...Be7  and the sophisticated  15...Nd7!?  .  I don't think we need to go too deep into all of those moves, but we should know how to handle the position for the first few moves, to develop our pieces in the most accurate way, making sure that Black doesn't get an easy life. } 15... Rde8 { Vidit has played this one twice. The idea is to make sure there won't be any sorcery happening around the f7-square, unlike the stuff that we can see in the 15...Rfe8 line.  On the other hand, now only one of the Black's rooks is active. } 16. Bf4 { Following in the footsteps of Praggnanandhaa, the boy seems to be aware of quite some theory in his Italian! } 16... Bg6 17. Nfd2 { We have to retreat, as  17.Nfg5  no longer works with f7-pawn being so well protected. } 17... Nd7 { Here little Prag played the aggressive  18.h4  , but since that aggression without the active knight on g5 led nowhere, I propose to improve with a slow but very poisonous new idea. } 18. Qf1 { Our plan is simple: we want to follow this up with a couple of more retreats, Kh1, Bh2 and then get ready to strike with f2-f4 if a knight shows up on e5 and if not, we can always activate our a1-rook, either by means of Rad1 or the thematic a2-a4 push.  White enjoys a bit of an edge here and Black is yet to fully neutralize our opening initiative, which is also confirmed by the engines, that just like humans, seem to value good piece coordination.  Note, how still, despite so many efforts, breaks and manoeuvres, Black still has got the c6-knight restricted by our c3-pawn - his eternal issue. } *

A couple of years ago, players have realized that there is more to it and that Black's dangers of a much deeper, more long-term nature.

We are happy to include f2-f4 and ...f7-f5, so let's do it. } 10... f5 11. Be3 { An important position to understand and the one you are likely to face if your opponent is not up to date on the latest trends at the highest level, as Black just made all the natural moves this far and has a very solid position, at least optically.  So why is White better? The answer must lie in the pawn structure, though not in the 'doubled pawns are bad' sense, but in a much more nuanced analysis of it.  The protected passed pawn on e5 gives us more space and thus more room to manoeuvre the bishops. Black's d5- as well as b7-pawn, are going to be targeted on the semi-open b- and d-files.  The advance ...c5, while closing the diagonal for the e3-bishop, will weaken the d5-pawn further.  After putting Black onto the defensive with Be2-Bf3, followed by a4-a5, White can then eventually prepare a breakthrough on the kingside with g2-g4 or in the center with the c3-c4-push.  Black, on the other hand, lacks counterplay. The ...g5-break, which is what Shirov tried, backfires due to the king's safety.  On the queenside, the doubled c-pawns are doing a good job at restricting Black's attempts to expand with ...b5 or the ...d5-d4-push, which are pretty much never feasible.  Let's now see how that manifests itself in the concrete moves. } 11... c5 { Played by Shirov. Carlsen right away shifted the bishop to target the d5-pawn. } 12.

The more direct  17.a5!  was good too, even though Carlsen chose a more conceptual approach. } 17... g5 { Black is pretty desperate at this point, as he can't also hope to survive this if he just stands passively. The problem now is, however, that his king is weaker than the White's king in the long run. } 18. h3 { Preventing ...g4. White maintains a significant advantage and the full game can and should be found in the model games section. } *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 { The move  3.d4!?  was recently brought back into fashion thanks to many interesting new discoveries. It is one of the main tests against the Petroff Defense.   One advantage of  3.d4  over the classical main move  3.Nxe5  is that many Petroff players still consider the latter to be the main move. } 3... Nxe4 4. Bd3 d5 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6. Nc3 { This system has gained in popularity quite a lot recently. I first noticed it before there have been many fresh high-level games, particularly, because I noticed the computers favoring White a lot, which was surprising, given that White ruins his queenside pawn structure for no immediately obvious benefits.  A while after that a few model games have been played, such as Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov and everyone has realized that there is quite some strategic danger for Black, in these positions.  The idea is that White wants to get rid of the strong e4-knight and the doubled c-pawns will do a decent job at stopping counterplay in the center and the queenside.  White, on the other hand, thanks to our pawn on e5 @@StartBracket@@after ...Nxe5 dxe5@@EndBracket@@ and a kingside majority, has good chances to develop play on the kingside.   I will examine three different concepts for Black here:  • Black taking both the knights,   • Black taking the e5-knight, but not the c3-knight:  6...Nxe5  7.dxe5  Bb4  ,   • Black taking the c3-knight, but not the e5-knight:  6...Nxc3  7.bxc3  Bd6  or  7...c5  . } 6... Nxe5 7. dxe5 Nxc3 8. bxc3 { Previously, this is how the games would go: Black would try to block the e5-pawn with ...Be6, get the ...f7-f5-push in, hoping that this would neutralize White's kingside majority and there would be nothing to worry about.

It is visible in the line with 9...Bb6: the same sequence of moves wouldn't work with  9.h3  Bh5  included because of  10.Nbd2  Bb6  11.a4  a5  12.Ne4  f6  13.d4  exd4  14.Qb3  when Black has  14...Bf7=  . } 9... Nb6 { A typical move in this variation. Black removes the vulnerable d5-knight with a tempo. Now it is a big moment for White. } 10. h3 { First we include this push, kicking the bishop away to h5, which is where we want the bishop to be in this particular line @@StartBracket@@note that we waited with this h3-push, until Black has shown his cards with 9...Nb6@@EndBracket@@. } 10... Bh5 { The retreat is the most natural and is the way they play. } 11. Bb3 { This was an epic idea first shown to me by my teammate Jorden van Foreest. It turns out that capturing the d3-pawn leads to some complications and more importantly, these complications seem to lead to unpleasant positions for Black.  By now there are a few dozen high-level games on this topic and there is still no consensus on how exactly Black is supposed to neutralize White's initiative. First Black has to choose, to capture the pawn or not to. } 11... Qxd3 { Capturing the pawn is the most direct way to go. } 12. Nxe5 { The complications are clearly about to start. Black is once again facing a tough choice: does he want to sit it out in a worse endgame after  12...Bxd1  , retreat with  12...Qf5  or try his luck with the crazy-looking  12...Qg3  ?. } 12... Qf5 { The best move. The queen simply defends the h5-bishop and also hits the f2-pawn, forcing White to retreat. } 13. Nef3 { We have traded our central pawns and Black appears to be doing quite well, but suddenly there is a very unpleasant threat of g2-g4. Black has a choice, mainly between allowing it and sacrificing on g4 or go into hiding. } 13... Rad8 { The most played move. It is doing a good job preparing a piece sac on g4, but unlike  13...Rfe8  and  13...Rae8  , it doesn't force the g4-push, as we have a good alternative in  @@StartFEN@@3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/1nn5/2b2q1b/8/1BP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 14@@EndFEN@@  14.Qe2  . } 14. Qe2 { After  14.g4  Bxg4  15.hxg4  Qxg4+  16.Kh1  Qh3+  17.Nh2  Bd6!  18.f4  Bxf4  Black already regained 3 pawns and still has a very active position - a better version of 13...Rfe8/13...Rae8 lines. White is able to reach a roughly equal endgame after  19.Re2  followed by Qf1 and the game Michalik-Shirov was drawn.   14.Qe2!  is more testing. White grabs control over the e-file and reinforces the threat of g2-g4, as well as Ne4!?. } 14... Nd5 { This is a very decent option and although it seems threatening, as the knight is heading to f4, it is pretty much forcing a slightly worse endgame, that Black then hopes to hold to a draw. } 15. Ne4 { This is the right way to play.   15.g4  is no longer possible, with ...Nf4 coming after the piece sac,  while  15.Qe4  leads to an endgame less promising than the one after  15.Ne4  . } 15... Bxf3 16. Qxf3 { Of course, when they ruin your king's pawn shelter like this, you have to get the queens off the board. } 16... Qxf3 17. gxf3 Bb6 { This endgame happened in MVL-Aronian and Dominguez-Aronian and in both cases, White wasn't quite ready for it. It seems, though, that the computers seem to value our bishop pair and better pieces slightly higher, than the pawn structure. } 18. a4 { I believe starting with  18.Kf1  is also possible, but  18.a4  is slightly more poisonous. When I first sketched this out as my course recommendation it was still a novelty, but by now its strength has also been confirmed by Dominguez, who has played this move against Levon in Aimchess US rapid 2021.  White hints at a well-timed a4-a5-push and hopes to provoke ...a7-a5 which would soften up the b6-bishop a great deal, strengthening Nd2-Nc4 and sometimes even Be3. } 18... h6 { Levon blitzed out the first engine move. Black is making a very useful waiting move, not committing to ...a5 just yet, nor removing the knight from d5 yet. In some variations down the road, Bf4 can be met with ...g5!. } 19. Kf1 { Lenier has probably mixed things up here and started with  19.Rd1  Nde7  20.Be3  , but that fell straight into  20...Nf5!  . Still, it was only because of  21.Bxb6?  that he ended up in trouble and lost the game. } 19... a5 { This is probably the most natural move, as it is hard to find another, more useful move at this point. } 20. Rd1 { The most direct and challenging option.   There is also a cunning option of  20.f4!?  , as an alternative to look into. } 20... Nde7 { The standard reaction. } 21. Be3 { The natural  21.Bf4  can be hit by  21...g5!  , when after  22.Bh2  Kg7!  23.f4  f5  Black is close to fully equalizing.  By offering a trade of bishops, we offer Black to rid us of our bishop pair, in exchange for fixing our pawn structure. A fair deal. } 21... Bxe3 { Trading bishops is very solid, but now we fix our pawn structure and can enjoy our remaining bishop on b3, which should be useful in a fight on two flanks. } 22. fxe3 b6 { Stopping any Nc5 business, which can be quite annoying. There are also other ways of playing, but essentially the position is what it is. } 23. Ke2 { The king can and should be slightly pushed up towards the center. Next, we want to slowly get our pawns rolling with Ng3, f4, Kf3, and perhaps eventually start advancing with e3-e4-e5 as well, but well, one step at a time.  The position should be defendable for Black, but I do see White having some potential here and the engines give White a small plus as well.   However, if trading the bishops doesn't give you a good feeling, it is possible to explore options, for example, @@StartFEN@@3r1rk1/1pp1npp1/1bn4p/p7/P3N3/1BP2P1P/1P3P2/R1BR1K2 w - - 2 21@@EndFEN@@  21.Bf4  . } *

O-O 6. O-O d5 { This is perhaps the most principled attempt at equalizing against our venomous Italian. Black wants to occupy the center, using the fact that White himself has chosen a slower plan of not going for the quick d3-d4.  This ambitious plan of Black, however, also has some significant drawbacks: the ...d7-d5-break costs a tempo, the knight on d5 will be temporarily exposed and the e5-pawn is now a target, with the rook being able to hit it along the semi-open e-file. And very importantly, the c6-knight is still a bad piece restricted by the c3-pawn; the break in the center doesn't address that issue. } 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Re1 { The most popular, natural and in my opinion also the most testing of the options.   Alternatively, the cunning move  8.a4!?  is also a venomous one. } 8...
