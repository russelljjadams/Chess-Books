{ The idea of a complete repertoire for White is not new and having done a few massive courses on Chessable for the black pieces I realized it was now the right time for me to do one.  My vision for the Lifetime Repertoire for White was to give you something that could actually last you a lifetime. I believe the concrete moves down the long variations are replaceable and possible to update, but the framework of the whole repertoire had to be healthy and ambitious enough so that there is that room for the replacements and the updates.  My idea is that if one of the suggestions I give, somewhere on move 20 can be neutralized, there would be room for you to deviate for your next game while staying within the same repertoire and still being able to use the ideas and concepts that I am going to be sharing here.   For that, I felt the Italian is the perfect weapon against the ever solid @@StartFEN@@rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1@@EndFEN@@  1.e4  e5  2.Nf3  Nc6  systems.    This course is the first part of the complete 1.e4 repertoire, covers all the options for Black after 1...e5, which is Black's main and most challenging response against our 1.e4. }
2. Nf3 Nc6
{ This being a Lifetime Repertoire, I also discuss all possible and impossible gambits and oddities @@StartBracket@@to the extent that  2...d5?  and even  2...Qe7?  are covered@@EndBracket@@ and also, obviously, the more respectable openings, such as the Philidor,  2...d6  , and the Petroff,  2...Nf6  , are covered.   Against the Petroff, I recommend 3.d4!? which I believe to be the most challenging way to play against this ever-solid opening.  2...Nf6  3.d4   I believe the Petroff players still take this move less seriously than  3.Nxe5  , something that they will certainly regret once they face us.  3...Nxe4  4.Bd3  d5  5.Nxe5  Nd7  6.Nc3!  This is the system I advocate against the main line of the Petroff. The pawn structure becomes very imbalanced right away and a world of strategic nuances awaits you in the chapters dedicated to the Petroff. }
3. Bc4
{ The Italian, though at this point it is not yet clear, whether we go for something forcing or the fundamental Italian, which is what I recommend.  The fundamental Italian is experiencing a renaissance already for quite a few years and there are two reasons for that - the negative one and the positive one.   The negative reason is that the Spanish  3.Bb5  , which has been the way to go at the highest level for decades, started experiencing serious issues.   Besides the infamous Berlin  3.Bb5  Nf6  , theory also started expanding in all sorts of directions:   • The Open Spanish  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  Nxe4   • and the Archangelsk  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  b5  6.Bb3  Bb7  are more alive than ever.   • The Marshall  3.Bb5  a6  4.Ba4  Nf6  5.O-O  Be7  6.Re1  b5  7.Bb3  O-O  8.c3  d5  has also never left.    While the Spanish remains a critical way to go, at this point players are often wondering what exactly they are hoping for when placing the bishop on b5, as all of Black's options are equally repelling.  The positive reason, on the other hand, is that it turned out that while the greatest theoreticians have been banging their heads against the Spanish wall, the Italian, which has been neglected, offers at the very least just as large a scope of ideas.  As the engines got stronger, around five years ago, there has been a major reassessment of many positions and positional factors that we encounter in the Italian. It turned out that places where people used to stop their analysis, were just the starting points. In some openings, having the space advantage in the center was overrated, while it was underrated in others. That pointless-looking queenside expansions can have a long-term effect on the rest of the board and that the pawn structure should not be taken out of context as piece activity is often a more important factor.  On a broader scale, the turning point was the humbling realization that the top chess players, the trendsetters, don't know everything about the opening theory and that we all have a lot to learn from the computer, more than we could have previously imagined. That 'it looks fine' is no longer a good point to stop the analysis if the engine is screaming numbers.  The humility and the open-mindedness are what has pushed the top players towards the fundamental Italian and in this course, I will try to give you a taste for the kind of strategic depth and tactical possibilities the opening has to offer. }
3... Bc5
{ 3...Nf6  This allows  4.Ng5  , which many fear, but that is more of a one-trick pony @@StartBracket@@pun intended@@EndBracket@@, compared to  4.d3  , as I believe once Black prepares for these forced lines, it is relatively easy to neutralize, as the scope of our possibilities is significantly smaller down those lines.   Against us, though, the  3...Nf6  move order is more flexible, but many of the players who go for ...Bc5-setups will play  3...Bc5  already here.   3...Nf6  4.d3  Here I obviously cover all of the options. Besides the ...Bc5-setup, there is the more modest and solid 4...Be7, but also the trendy fianchetto systems with ...h7-h6+g7-g5 and ...h7-h6+g7-g6.  The sidelines like the risky 4...d5 are also covered of course! }
4. c3 Nf6 5. d3
{ Followed by 6.O-O is the core of our repertoire.  Our setup is then somewhat dependent on our opponent’s choice, but in the long run, in many of the systems, we will eventually prepare the central push d3-d4. Conceptually speaking, the idea is to prepare and mobilize and then once fully ready go for the clash in the center. I believe this is a good way to play chess. }

5... O-O 6. O-O d5
{ This is perhaps the most principled attempt at equalizing against our venomous Italian. Black wants to occupy the center, using the fact that White himself has chosen a slower plan of not going for the quick d3-d4.  This ambitious plan of Black, however, also has some significant drawbacks: the ...d7-d5-break costs a tempo, the knight on d5 will be temporarily exposed and the e5-pawn is now a target, with the rook being able to hit it along the semi-open e-file. And very importantly, the c6-knight is still a bad piece restricted by the c3-pawn; the break in the center doesn't address that issue. }
7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Re1
{ The most popular, natural and in my opinion also the most testing of the options.   Alternatively, the cunning move  8.a4!?  is also a venomous one. }
8... Be6
{ This has once been played by Anand against Kramnik in a rapid game.   The trick is that the e5-pawn is not actually hanging because after  9.Nxe5?  Nxe5  10.Rxe5  there is  10...Bxf2+!  11.Kxf2  Qf6+!  ,  which is a common theme in these positions. In fact, the threat is stronger than the execution so we just keep our eyes on the e5-pawn and continue developing. }
9. Nbd2
{ White reinforces the Nxe5 threat. The same ...Qf6+ trick would no longer work because of Nf3, protecting the rook on e5:   9...--  10.Nxe5  Nxe5  11.Rxe5  Bxf2+??  12.Kxf2  Qf6+  13.Nf3+-  . }
9... Bd6 10. a4
{ A very clever improvement on Kramnik's play. White's development scheme in this structure is generally Ne4, b2-b4, a2-a4 and a4-a5, grabbing space on the queenside and while Kramnik started with the natural Ne4 followed by b2-b4, the computer comes up with a much more sophisticated move order.  If we start with a4-a5 first, we create a nasty threat of Qb3 @@StartBracket@@as the ...Na5! idea is dealt with@@EndBracket@@ and after Black protects against it with a useless move like ...Rb8, only then do we proceed with Ne4 and b2-b4, gaining that small tempo on the way. Very nice! }
10... Re8 11. a5 { Now that ...Na5 is prevented, Qb3 is a real threat. } 11...
Rb8
{ A useless move, in general, but here it was necessary to guard the b7-pawn against Qb3. }
12. Ne4
{ Now we proceed with the standard development scheme. The knight not only is active on the e4-square, but it also guards the c3-pawn, so our b-pawn can advance. }
12... h6 { Black has to prevent Ng5. } 13. b4 a6
{ Stopping White's expansion, but the deadlock that we have established on the queenside is to our advantage. In the long term, the b7-pawn is weak, and Black's queenside is cramped. }
14. Qb3 { Upping the pressure. } 14... Nf6 15. Be3
{ We have finished our development comfortably. Black can simplify, but he can't equalize. }
15... Nxe4
{ This trade is not solving the issue of the inferiority of Black's queenside pawn structure and the bad c6-knight. }
16. dxe4 Bxc4 17. Qxc4
{ This is one kind of position we are often aiming for in the slow Italian. Although there is some symmetry, all the minor imbalances in the position are in White's favor. We have a better bishop, a better knight and a better pawn structure on the queenside.  Next up we want to slightly improve our kingside with g2-g3+Kg2 and perhaps double on the d-file, before taking further actions. Also, the f3-knight is always ready to embark on journeys, usually via d2 to c4 or b3-c5. }

{ The most popular, natural and in my opinion also the most testing of the options.   Alternatively, the cunning move  8.a4!?  is also a venomous one. }
8... Bg4
{ By far the most often played move. Black develops the last minor piece and on the way deals with the issue of the e5-pawn by pinning its attacker. }
9. Nbd2
{ Starting with this move is smarter than including  9.h3  Bh5  first.   It is visible in the line with 9...Bb6: the same sequence of moves wouldn't work with  9.h3  Bh5  included because of  10.Nbd2  Bb6  11.a4  a5  12.Ne4  f6  13.d4  exd4  14.Qb3  when Black has  14...Bf7=  . }
9... Nb6
{ A typical move in this variation. Black removes the vulnerable d5-knight with a tempo. Now it is a big moment for White. }
10. h3
{ First we include this push, kicking the bishop away to h5, which is where we want the bishop to be in this particular line @@StartBracket@@note that we waited with this h3-push, until Black has shown his cards with 9...Nb6@@EndBracket@@. }
10... Bh5 { The retreat is the most natural and is the way they play. } 11. Bb3
{ This was an epic idea first shown to me by my teammate Jorden van Foreest. It turns out that capturing the d3-pawn leads to some complications and more importantly, these complications seem to lead to unpleasant positions for Black.  By now there are a few dozen high-level games on this topic and there is still no consensus on how exactly Black is supposed to neutralize White's initiative. First Black has to choose, to capture the pawn or not to. }
11... Qxd3 { Capturing the pawn is the most direct way to go. } 12. Nxe5
{ The complications are clearly about to start. Black is once again facing a tough choice: does he want to sit it out in a worse endgame after  12...Bxd1  , retreat with  12...Qf5  or try his luck with the crazy-looking  12...Qg3  ?. }
12... Qf5
{ The best move. The queen simply defends the h5-bishop and also hits the f2-pawn, forcing White to retreat. }
13. Nef3
{ We have traded our central pawns and Black appears to be doing quite well, but suddenly there is a very unpleasant threat of g2-g4. Black has a choice, mainly between allowing it and sacrificing on g4 or go into hiding. }
13... Rad8
{ The most played move. It is doing a good job preparing a piece sac on g4, but unlike  13...Rfe8  and  13...Rae8  , it doesn't force the g4-push, as we have a good alternative in  @@StartFEN@@3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/1nn5/2b2q1b/8/1BP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 14@@EndFEN@@  14.Qe2  . }
14. Qe2
{ After  14.g4  Bxg4  15.hxg4  Qxg4+  16.Kh1  Qh3+  17.Nh2  Bd6!  18.f4  Bxf4  Black already regained 3 pawns and still has a very active position - a better version of 13...Rfe8/13...Rae8 lines. White is able to reach a roughly equal endgame after  19.Re2  followed by Qf1 and the game Michalik-Shirov was drawn.   14.Qe2!  is more testing. White grabs control over the e-file and reinforces the threat of g2-g4, as well as Ne4!?. }
14... Qc8
{ A very logical and popular retreat. Black walks out of g2-g4 and prepares ...Rfe8.   Weaker is  14...Qd7?!  as after  15.Ne4!  Rfe8  there is  16.Nxc5!  hitting that queen. }
15. Ne4
{ I believe this move has not yet exhausted its resources, but Magnus Carlsen played the clever  15.Qb5!?  Nd7  16.Nh4!  a6  17.Qf1!  and posed problems to Wesley So.   Black should play  17...g5!  according to the engines,  but it wasn't surprising to see Wesley play the human  17...Be7  only to end up worse after  18.Nf5!  .   After  15.Ne4  Black is at a crossroads. He can play the natural  15...Rfe8  , but also  15...Rde8!?  has its points, keeping f7 better protected. Other than that, there is the simple  15...Be7  and the sophisticated  15...Nd7!?  .  I don't think we need to go too deep into all of those moves, but we should know how to handle the position for the first few moves, to develop our pieces in the most accurate way, making sure that Black doesn't get an easy life. }
15... Rde8
{ Vidit has played this one twice. The idea is to make sure there won't be any sorcery happening around the f7-square, unlike the stuff that we can see in the 15...Rfe8 line.  On the other hand, now only one of the Black's rooks is active. }
16. Bf4
{ Following in the footsteps of Praggnanandhaa, the boy seems to be aware of quite some theory in his Italian! }
16... Bg6 17. Nfd2
{ We have to retreat, as  17.Nfg5  no longer works with f7-pawn being so well protected. }
17... Nd7
{ Here little Prag played the aggressive  18.h4  , but since that aggression without the active knight on g5 led nowhere, I propose to improve with a slow but very poisonous new idea. }
18. Qf1
{ Our plan is simple: we want to follow this up with a couple of more retreats, Kh1, Bh2 and then get ready to strike with f2-f4 if a knight shows up on e5 and if not, we can always activate our a1-rook, either by means of Rad1 or the thematic a2-a4 push.  White enjoys a bit of an edge here and Black is yet to fully neutralize our opening initiative, which is also confirmed by the engines, that just like humans, seem to value good piece coordination.  Note, how still, despite so many efforts, breaks and manoeuvres, Black still has got the c6-knight restricted by our c3-pawn - his eternal issue. }

8. h3
{ Those who had seen other chapters, already noticed that I like starting with this move in my course. By keeping the knight on b1, we remain flexible and have the options of developing our c1-bishop or pushing d3-d4.  Throughout the ...a5-chapter, as well as some other chapters in this course, I am constantly going for the positions with a quick d3-d4-push.  I believe this ambitious approach can pose Black a lot of practical problems. It is very unpleasant to play against a strong pawn center. }
8... h6
{ This is the most popular move. Black is copying us, remaining flexible and waiting for us to commit to Nbd2 before going ...Be6. I recommend a similar approach as in the Italian 6...a6 − 9...a5 and Italian 6...O-O 7.Re1 h6 8.h3 Bb6 chapters: to grab the center quickly with d3-d4. }
9. d4
{ A cool rare idea, but it is by no means new. It has been played somewhat more often in the ... a6-a5-variation, where we have the same position, but already have our pawn on a4.  The pawn on a4 has both advantages and disadvantages as well, as now, for example, after the eventual ...exd4 trade, our b4-square is not weak.  If you think it is strange to first play d3 and then d4 this quickly and I am not authority for you, then I will reassure you that this move is good, since it has also been employed by Magnus Carlsen. Happy now?  Jokes aside, compared to the early c3+d4-systems, which is what Wesley So recommends in his course, here we are a lot better equipped to protect our pawn center and Black will struggle to find ways to create counterplay against it. }

Obviously, White always has options in a position like this and it is possible to play it less subtle.  15.Bf4  is a legit option as well. }
15... Be6
{ Black can also just develop, but as always in this kind of position, if both sides just develop, then I feel White should be quite happy. We have the long term advantage of having more space in the center and are happy as long as we keep Black on some distance and avoid direct counterplay. }

It turned out, however, that the strong protected passed e5-pawn gives White more space and a long-term edge, while Black's queenside pawns are targets and his lack of space as well as lack of counterplay makes the position very unpleasant and hard to play.  We will see how this manifests itself in concrete variations in this chapter, but also in the model games, where we can see how White can eventually break through this optically solid position that Black has. }

{ This is the old move, when Black tried to just finish his development and assumed that if the kingside majority can be neutralized with ...f7-f5 after f2-f4, then there would be nothing to fear.  A couple of years ago, players have realized that there is more to it and that Black's dangers of a much deeper, more long-term nature.  I will give show here the start of games Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov, but in the model games section, I will analyze the two games to the end.

{ An important position to understand and the one you are likely to face if your opponent is not up to date on the latest trends at the highest level, as Black just made all the natural moves this far and has a very solid position, at least optically.  So why is White better? The answer must lie in the pawn structure, though not in the 'doubled pawns are bad' sense, but in a much more nuanced analysis of it.  The protected passed pawn on e5 gives us more space and thus more room to manoeuvre the bishops. Black's d5- as well as b7-pawn, are going to be targeted on the semi-open b- and d-files.  The advance ...c5, while closing the diagonal for the e3-bishop, will weaken the d5-pawn further.  After putting Black onto the defensive with Be2-Bf3, followed by a4-a5, White can then eventually prepare a breakthrough on the kingside with g2-g4 or in the center with the c3-c4-push.  Black, on the other hand, lacks counterplay. The ...g5-break, which is what Shirov tried, backfires due to the king's safety.  On the queenside, the doubled c-pawns are doing a good job at restricting Black's attempts to expand with ...b5 or the ...d5-d4-push, which are pretty much never feasible.  Let's now see how that manifests itself in the concrete moves. }

17... g5

{ This system has gained in popularity quite a lot recently. I first noticed it before there have been many fresh high-level games, particularly, because I noticed the computers favoring White a lot, which was surprising, given that White ruins his queenside pawn structure for no immediately obvious benefits.  A while after that a few model games have been played, such as Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov and everyone has realized that there is quite some strategic danger for Black, in these positions.  The idea is that White wants to get rid of the strong e4-knight and the doubled c-pawns will do a decent job at stopping counterplay in the center and the queenside.

{ In openings with a manoeuvring character, when there is no direct confrontation between the white and black pieces, such as the 'slow' Italian with 4.d3, both sides have a certain degree of freedom in choosing their move orders.   We intend to play the same moves every time, but our opponents will not play along for various reasons: they either want to avoid certain systems or they try to confuse or even trick us.   In this chapter you can practice the different move orders in the Italian. In fact, it is much simpler than it may look.  After learning this chapter, you will never find yourself in a position that is outside our repertoire.

White's development scheme in this structure is generally Ne4, b2-b4, a2-a4 and a4-a5, grabbing space on the queenside and while Kramnik started with the natural Ne4 followed by b2-b4, the computer comes up with a much more sophisticated move order.  If we start with a4-a5 first, we create a nasty threat of Qb3 @@StartBracket@@as the ...Na5! idea is dealt with@@EndBracket@@ and after Black protects against it with a useless move like ...Rb8, only then do we proceed with Ne4 and b2-b4, gaining that small tempo on the way. Very nice! }

12. Ne4

12... h6 { Black has to prevent Ng5. } 13. b4 a6

15... Nxe4

16. dxe4 Bxc4 17. Qxc4
{ This is one kind of position we are often aiming for in the slow Italian. Although there is some symmetry, all the minor imbalances in the position are in White's favor. We have a better bishop, a better knight and a better pawn structure on the queenside.  Next up we want to slightly improve our kingside with g2-g3+Kg2 and perhaps double on the d-file, before taking further actions. Also, the f3-knight is always ready to embark on journeys, usually via d2 to c4 or b3-c5. }

Without the piece play, the f4-pawn is just a weakness and even though he is a pawn up, for now, it is Black who is definitely on the defensive.  Frankly speaking, knowing Maxime quite well, I suspect he may simply have mixed up and was aiming for this position during his preparation. }

21... Nf5
{ White can trade on b6, when compared to the game Dominguez-Aronian, with Kf1 & ...a7-a5 included, Black's pawn structure is much worse, as ...cxb6 weakens the d6-square.  However, I prefer to keep the bishop pair after all. }

18. Qf1
{ Our plan is simple: we want to follow this up with a couple of more retreats, Kh1, Bh2 and then get ready to strike with f2-f4 if a knight shows up on e5 and if not, we can always activate our a1-rook, either by means of Rad1 or the thematic a2-a4 push.  White enjoys a bit of an edge here and Black is yet to fully neutralize our opening initiative, which is also confirmed by the engines, that just like humans, seem to value good piece coordination.  Note, how still, despite so many efforts, breaks and manoeuvres, Black still has got the c6-knight restricted by our c3-pawn - his eternal issue. }

{ This is the move I will go with for this course, though the beauty of the Italian is that you can adjust to your opponent and mix things up.

{ This, intending to play ...Be6 and then recapture with the rook, without doubling the pawns is probably the most solid setup one can play against the Italian.

{ I have played this cunning move on various occasions and I have chosen this as my main recommendation.  It is not clear whether the bishop is that well placed on b2 at the moment, as the a1-h8-diagonal is rather closed, but the main purpose of this move is prophylaxis. We are basically bracing for the ...d5-break, after which we intend to start some complications, including an eventual c3-c4 and our bishop activating itself.  The bishop also does a good job defending the c3-pawn in these ...d5-variations and finally, if the c6-knight chooses to go to g6, we can then push c3-c4 and eventually also d3-d4, when our bishop will start looking quite good on the long diagonal. }

{ White has to address the ...Na5 threat with the traditional move  7.Bb3  or the modern  7.a4!  .   After  7.Bb3  White would play Nbd2, h2-h3 and Re1, intending to bring the knight to g3 with Nd2-f1-g3. Black found different setups that are acceptable against this.

White in his turn will push b4 and hope to claim a small but lasting edge, thanks to more space on the queenside and the better-arranged knights. }

We are basically bracing for the ...d5-break, after which we intend to start some complications, including an eventual c3-c4 and our bishop activating itself.  The bishop also does a good job defending the c3-pawn in these ...d5-variations and finally, if the c6-knight chooses to go to g6, we can then push c3-c4 and eventually also d3-d4, when our bishop will start looking quite good on the long diagonal. }

The point of the knight on h2, in general, is that it does as good a job defending the f3-knight as it does on d2, but it is not in the way of our other pieces, particularly the c1-bishop.  In the long run, of course, there are also Ng4 ideas and the fact that after the h3-h4-push the g4-square is protected is another upside as well.

If you don't enjoy this kind of positional pressure, you are missing out. }

After  7.Bb3  White would play Nbd2, h2-h3 and Re1, intending to bring the knight to g3 with Nd2-f1-g3. Black found different setups that are acceptable against this.   The topical  7.a4!?  preserves the light-squared bishop too, while it also gains space on the queenside - a factor that engines taught us to appreciate more and more. }
7... Ba7

8. Re1 O-O 9. h3
{ This is important. While there are many different orders, combining Re1 and Nbd2 without h2-h3 would be a serious inaccuracy as it allows ...Ng4!:  9.Nbd2  Ng4!  10.Re2  Kh8!  11.h3  f5!  and Black is having quite some fun at our expense. }

{ The principled thing is to capture the bishop and double the pawns, but it is also possible to play the less ambitious  11.b4  , allowing the trade on c4, leading to positions similar to the 10...Re8 chapter, where Black gets to trade the bishops without doubling the f-pawn. }
11. Bxe6 fxe6 12. b4
{ We want to grab that space on the queenside. There is no point for White to postpone this move - in fact, if he does so, Black may very well consider going ...a6-a5!?, preventing the expansion altogether.   After  12.b4  Black can make a bunch of different moves, but essentially the strong players have been choosing from two different plans: one is ...Nh5-Nf4 and the other is ...Ne7-Ng6.   12...Qe8  and  12...Qd7  are just delaying that, while another idea that comes to mind, ...g7-g5, seems more weakening than offensive. }
12... Ne7
{ This is a very solid system, that has been played twice by Bacrot, who, being a second of MVL, I suspect is very well versed in the intricacies of the Italian.  This system is somewhat of a hybrid between the ...Ne7-Ng6 and ...Be6-systems. Black wants to reroute the knight to the kingside, not so much to attack there, but rather to free up his c-pawn and eventually start liberating play in the center and the queenside with ...c7-c5 and ...d6-d5.  I wasn't able to find a tangible advantage against this system, not because I hadn't tried, but just because the position is way too solid and healthy for Black.  At the same time, as we will see down the road, Black doesn't get much fun here and is constantly landing himself in drawish, yet very slightly worse positions.   12...Qd7  13.Nf1  There doesn't seem to be too much point to Black's move ...Qd7 without ...Ne7, after which he is likely to eventually transpose to the 12...Ne7-system.   12...Qe8  is a reasonable move and has been played a bunch of times, but mainly with the idea to transpose back into the 12...Nh5 line on the next move.  13.Nf1  Nh5  transposing to 12...Nh5 13.Nf1 Qe8. }
13. Nf1
{ The knight should be rerouted.   I tried also  13.d4  ideas, but Black has nicely braced for it with  13...Ng6  , followed by ...Nd7+Qe7 and doubling along the f-file. }
13... Ng6 14. N1h2
{ This is a new move.   Magnus has won that famously 'not-so-smooth' game against Etienne after  14.Ra2  , which is a fine flexible move, but I think the text move could be more useful and also easier to understand and follow up.   After  14.Ra2  Etienne improved on his game against Magnus with  14...Qe8!?  keeping the option of ...c7-c5, as well as freeing up the d8-square for the rook.   With  14.N1h2  , I propose to solidify our f3-knight and intend to follow this up with g2-g3+Kg2, taking the f4-square from the g6-knight and getting a very solid and harmonious setup on the kingside.   The point of the knight on h2, in general, is that it does as good a job defending the f3-knight as it does on d2, but it is not in the way of our other pieces, particularly the c1-bishop.  In the long run, of course, there are also Ng4 ideas and the fact that after the h3-h4-push the g4-square is protected is another upside as well.  Now I give a few different sample variations, but in essence, it is all similar. }

15. g3 { Continuing our plan. } 15... c5 16. Be3

There is no point for White to postpone this move - in fact, if he does so, Black may very well consider going ...a6-a5!?, preventing the expansion altogether.   After  12.b4  Black can make a bunch of different moves, but essentially the strong players have been choosing from two different plans: one is ...Nh5-Nf4 and the other is ...Ne7-Ng6.   12...Qe8  and  12...Qd7  are just delaying that, while another idea that comes to mind, ...g7-g5, seems more weakening than offensive. }
12... Nh5
{ This is the standard way to play here. I myself used this plan once against Carlsen and that's also what Kramnik did on numerous occasions. Black sends the knight to f4 and starts piling up on the f-file. It sounds easy, but his kingside initiative is for now very hypothetical, while the doubled e-pawns are long term factors that are to our advantage.  Also, structurally speaking, White is always ready to hit in the center with d3-d4 @@StartBracket@@often after ...b7-b5 first@@EndBracket@@, while if Black goes ...d6-d5, all he achieves is the weakening of the e5-pawn.   12...Qd7  13.Nf1  There doesn't seem to be too much point to Black's move ...Qd7 without ...Ne7, after which he is likely to eventually transpose to the 12...Ne7-system.   12...Qe8  is a reasonable move and has been played a bunch of times, but mainly with the idea to transpose back into the 12...Nh5 line on the next move.  13.Nf1  Nh5  transposing to 12...Nh5 13.Nf1 Qe8. }
13. Nf1
{ I believe this is where the knight belongs.  • One idea to keep in mind here, just like in the 12...Ne7-variation, is to send the knight to h2, to reinforce the f3-knight and eventually get the g2-g3+Kg2-setup, but that is the long term.  • Another common idea is to trade the active a7-bishop with Be3 and it depends on circumstances, whether White gets something going after that, or not.  • Instead of trading the bishops, often White is also happy to get rid of the strong knight on f4 by simply capturing it with the bishop.  • Finally, the way we eventually get things going is with a d3-d4-push, often after ...b7-b5 first, but for this, we have to choose the right moment.  In general, the position is very nuanced, and it is important to make a few precise moves at the start to make sure we get a good version of things and gain some tempi on the way.   After  13.Nf1  , Black will sooner or later play ...Nf4, but his queen has two different paths, the direct ...Qf6 or the more cunning ...Qe8-g6/h5 manoeuvre, keeping the f4-knight defended by the rook, to recapture with ...Rxf4, instead of the less desirable ...Qxf4. }
13... Qe8
{ This is more cunning and it seems objectively slightly more accurate than Qf6. The idea is to not get in the way of the f8-rook and be able to recapture on f4 with the rook and not the queen. The queen ideally wants to land somewhere on h5/g6 or f7, if it is behind the rook once it captures the knight on f4.   Starting with  13...Nf4  is perfectly fine too:  14.Ra2  Qe8  transposes to 13...Qe8 and  @@StartFEN@@r2q1rk1/bpp3p1/p1npp2p/4p2n/PP2P3/2PP1N1P/5PP1/R1BQRNK1 b - - 2 13@@EndFEN@@  13...Nf4  14.Ra2  Qf6  transposes to 13...Qf6. }
14. Ra2
{ This is the universally accepted useful move in this line. White not only overprotects the f2-pawn but is also preparing b5, as now there no longer is the axb5 axb5 Bxf2+ tactic. }
14... Nf4
{ There is not much sense in delaying this move. The knight is a great piece here and Black will be happy to recapture it with a rook so that he can then comfortably double or even triple on the f-file. }
15. Kh2
{ I tried different versions, but finally settled on this move.   There is also  15.N1h2  Qg6  16.Bxf4  Rxf4  17.b5!?  which computers briefly get excited about, but after  17...Nb8  18.bxa6  both  18...Nxa6  and  18...bxa6  lead to positions that seem fine in the end.  I propose to not rush the b4-b5-push before it leads anywhere and keep the tension. Here I examine all three queen moves, each of them logical in its own way. }
15... Qf7
{ This prevents g2-g3, but now that the queen is in the way of the rook, we are going to capture on f4. }
16. Bxf4
{ I have also examined the other options in quite some depth, but I feel this is a good recommendation.  We have a simple plan: on the kingside, we want to establish the N1h2+g2-g3+Kg2-construction and on the queenside, we want to push b4-b5 at some point.  Black doesn't have an easy life and is likely to end up with a relatively bad bishop against our good knight. }
16... Qxf4+ 17. Kh1 Qf7
{ Black is doing himself a favor by trying to rearrange his pieces. Doubling on the f-file with the queen on f4 is not a good idea, as the queen will lack squares. }
18. N1h2
{ Overprotecting the f3-knight and preparing the desired g2-g3+Kg2 setup. After that, we will decide when and how to push b4-b5 and d3-d4. }
18... Rae8
{ The most natural move. The engine also suggests other moves, that are all roughly similar.   18...Rac8  is one that stands high. Against that, I propose to react the same way, with the preventing  19.Rb2!  , anticipating ...a6-a5, just like in our 18...Rae8 line @@StartBracket@@the text move@@EndBracket@@. }
19. Rb2
{ Human touch! This move drowns in the sea of different options that the engine suggests, but I believe from the logical point of view it is a pretty clever one. Black wanted to go ...a5 b5 Nb8, against which we are now perfectly prepared.   If instead, we had gone for the natural  19.g3  , which is indeed a part of our plan, then after  19...a5!  20.b5  Nb8  we would not have the d3-d4! option, as Black would be able to take and play e5, hitting our rook on a2:  21.d4  exd4  22.cxd4  e5!⩱  .   Also, the rook on b2 is getting ready for the opening of the b-file, which is likely after ...a5 b5 Nb8 happens, followed by an eventual ...c6 bxc6 bxc6. }
19... a5
{ Black's best is to just sit and wait, but he ran out of useful moves at this point. This operation doesn't bring him anything great. }
20. b5 Nb8 21. d4
{ Good moment for this push. As soon as the c6-knight leaves, we are ready for this central push transforming our positional advantage, from having a more fluid pawn structure to having a strong pawn center. }
21... exd4 22. cxd4 Nd7 23. Ng4
{ White has a well-protected pawn center and the desired breaks, like ...c7-c6 and ...e6-e5 are unattractive. If this is not a +=, then I don't know what is.  As always, the knight on g4 is doing a great job contributing to the fight for e5- and f6-squares, while ...h6-h5 will weaken Black's kingside. }

After  7.Bb3  White would play Nbd2, h2-h3 and Re1, intending to bring the knight to g3 with Nd2-f1-g3. Black found different setups that are acceptable against this.

{ The plan of ...Ne7-Ng6 can be played with and without the inclusion of ...h7-h6. There is definitely a point in playing ...h7-h6 first because now White is already committed to Nbd2 and the immediate d3-d4-push is well met by ...Nc6! back an idea that we see in the ...Bb6+Ne7 chapter. }

The g6-bishop will eventually be hanging, but there is also the idea of pushing f5-f6, creating a mating box around the black king.

It could, of course, go to g3, but with the b-file open and the a6-pawn potentially being a target, the d2-square looks attractive as well, with the knight potentially heading to c4. }

11... Nh5
{ Grischuk has played it and I also faced this move against Zhigalko. It is hard to fully formulate the purpose of this move, but as far as I can understand, the idea is to make White commit himself to the move g2-g3 early on. I do think in many cases the g2-g3-push can be a part of our plan.  An important thing to note is that if Black wants to play this ...Nh5 move, he has to do it without trading on e3, because of the Nxe5 tactic. }

17. Kg2
{ A useful move. I heard somewhere recently that if there is space between the king and a pawn @@StartBracket@@the g3-pawn in this case@@EndBracket@@, the king has to close this gap. I'm not sure how universal that rule is, but here it does apply. }
17... Qf7 18. Rf1
{ We could also bring the rook to the c1-/d1-/e1-squares, it has a purpose on each of these squares. On f1, it does a good job overprotecting the f2-pawn, just in case. Now we have our pieces on more or less ideal squares, we will probably push d3-d4 next. }
18... Nd7 19. d4
{ Starting the confrontation in the center. It's hard for Black to come up with exciting ideas here, as White is fully mobilized and our pawn structure is just a tad more pleasant.   Instead of  19.d4  , it was also possible to remove the f3-knight and flirt with f2-f4 ideas. }

Nh7 25. g3

25... Rxa7 26. bxa5

Throughout the ...a5-chapter, as well as some other chapters in this course, I am constantly going for the positions with a quick d3-d4-push.  I believe this ambitious approach can pose Black a lot of practical problems. It is very unpleasant to play against a strong pawn center. }
8... Be6
{ This is a relatively rare, but very fashionable system. Black wants to do without the waiting move ...h7-h6. }
9. Bb5
{ It also makes sense to use the fact that we haven't played Nbd2 yet and play it simple with  9.Bxe6  fxe6  10.Be3  , but after  10...Bxe3  11.Rxe3  d5!?  , followed by a quick ...d4, @@StartBracket@@Jorden@@EndBracket@@ van Foreest got quite some counterplay in his game against Aronian.   We have looked at similar positions in this chapter, but we usually had our b1-knight better mobilized, making us more equipped to fight this forcing battle in the center. }
9... Ba7
{ This retreat feels very natural, but there is something to be said for  9...Bb6!?  as well. }
10. d4
{ Here too, I propose we stick to our concept of grabbing the center early on and then doing our utmost to protect it.  Alternatively,  10.Nbd2  Ne7  leads to complications I chose to avoid, while  10.Be3  as played by Adams feels a little timid. }
10... Bd7 11. Ba4
{ A recurring theme, bringing the bishop back to protect the e4-pawn. } 11...
h6 12. Bc2
{ We have our e4-pawn well-guarded now and Black is at a major crossroad. }
12... Re8
{ The most natural move in the position, putting some pressure on the e4-pawn. }
13. a4
{ In this version, with the bishop being on a7, this is an excellent move. We fix the b5-square and intend Na3-Nb5 next, gaining a tempo on the a7-bishop.   Alternatives are less accurate here.  13.a3  falls into  13...g5!  , which is stronger here than in the version with the bishop on b6, because we don't get the tempo on the b6-bishop after  14.Nbd2  g4  15.hxg4  Nxg4  16.Nc4  .   The typical  13.Be3  is possible, but harmless in this version, after  13...exd4  14.Bxd4  Nxd4  15.cxd4  c5  16.e5  Nh5  , when again, the bishop on a7 is well placed, as this time it doesn't come under attack after  17.Nc3  cxd4  18.Nd5  .   After  13.a4  Black again has a tough choice to make. }
13... Rc8
{ A decent waiting move here, anticipating  14.Be3  , which can now be met with  14...exd4  15.Bxd4  Nxd4  16.cxd4  c5!  and the rook is well placed on the c-file. }
14. Na3 { This is well-timed here. The knight is heading towards b5. } 14...
exd4
{ Now that our knight has left b1-square and we don't have Nc3, it makes a lot of sense to get rid of the pawn tension in the center and get that b4-square for the knight. }
15. Nxd4 { Is a lot simpler, though less ambitious. } 15... d5
{ A well-timed break in the center. } 16. Nxc6 Bxc6 17. e5 Ne4 18. Be3
{ The e5-pawn can't be captured after the trade on e3, because of the pin on the e-file. }
18... Bxe3 19. Rxe3 Qg5
{ Taking the pawn was losing:  19....Rxe5?  20.f3!  Qg5  21.Qd4!  .  This strong move, however, does work. }
20. Qd4 f5
{ The complications after  21.f3  f4!  22.Ree1  Rxe5!  lead to some sort of a forced draw down the line, so I suggest going for a simple endgame instead. }
21. exf6 Qxf6 { Now a lot of trades happen. } 22. Bxe4 Qxd4 23. cxd4 Rxe4 24.
Rxe4 dxe4 25. Nc4
{ With a pretty level endgame. I like White's position, but things got very simplified. With so many mutual weaknesses a peaceful outcome is likely.    My main recommendation 15. Nb5!? is more testing. }

What usually happens, when Black manages to push his pawn to a4, is that we will get rid of it by pushing b3 or b4, but then Black gets to trade a pair of pawns and also most likely a pair of rooks on the queenside, which will very much help his cause, as the side with less space wants to trade as much as possible.

If you think it is strange to first play d3 and then d4 this quickly and I am not authority for you, then I will reassure you that this move is good, since it has also been employed by Magnus Carlsen.

{ Those who had seen other chapters, already noticed that I like starting with this move in my course. By keeping the knight on b1, we remain flexible and have the options of developing our c1-bishop or pushing d3-d4.  Throughout the ...a5-chapter, as well as some other chapters in this course, I am constantly going for the positions with a quick d3-d4-push.  I believe this ambitious approach can pose Black a lot of practical problems. It is very unpleasant to play against a strong pawn center. }
8... h6
{ This is the most popular move. Black is copying us, remaining flexible and waiting for us to commit to Nbd2 before going ...Be6. I recommend a similar approach as in the Italian 6...a6 − 9...a5 and Italian 6...O-O 7.Re1 h6 8.h3 Bb6 chapters: to grab the center quickly with d3-d4. }
9. d4
{ A cool rare idea, but it is by no means new. It has been played somewhat more often in the ... a6-a5-variation, where we have the same position, but already have our pawn on a4.  The pawn on a4 has both advantages and disadvantages as well, as now, for example, after the eventual ...exd4 trade, our b4-square is not weak.  If you think it is strange to first play d3 and then d4 this quickly and I am not authority for you, then I will reassure you that this move is good, since it has also been employed by Magnus Carlsen. Happy now?  Jokes aside, compared to the early c3+d4-systems, which is what Wesley So recommends in his course, here we are a lot better equipped to protect our pawn center and Black will struggle to find ways to create counterplay against it. }

{ Black can also just develop, but as always in this kind of position, if both sides just develop, then I feel White should be quite happy. We have the long term advantage of having more space in the center and are happy as long as we keep Black on some distance and avoid direct counterplay. }

7... Be6
{ This is a common idea in this system. Black offers a trade of bishops, willing to double his pawns in return for potential counterplay along the f-file.  With the knight being on c3, we generally respond with Nd5!, as trading on e6 would mean that our control of the d5-square vanishes and there is then little purpose to the knight being on c3.   With that in mind, though,  8.Bxe6  fxe6  9.Ne2!  , followed by Ng3 is definitely a possibility as well. }
8. Nd5

14... f5 { The obvious follow up, as Black has to connect his pawns. } 15. g4
{ A strong move, undermining the pawn chain and trying to open some files and diagonals.  With ideas like the Ra3-Rh3 rook lift as well as the f2-f3-break, White has quite some potential to cause trouble for Black on the kingside.  Definitely, something that can be investigated further. }

7. Nc3
{ I have tried all kinds of setups here, but finally, I decided to recommend the same one I recommend against all of the systems in which Black doesn't develop his bishop on c5 but chooses to develop it to e7 or g7.   The simple  7.Nc3  , with the idea to reinforce control over the d5-square and not put the pawn to c3 just yet, as, without the bishop on c5, the idea of ...Nd4 is not attractive for Black, as, after the trade on d4, he will have to double his pawns.   The alternative and the setup that is very slightly preferred by the best modern engines of today is the advance of the a-pawn with  7.a5  and eventually a5-a6 as well.  After going deeper into those lines, however, I had come to the conclusion that the play that arises there is far too unconventional, the position is too hard to play and White's advantage is far from being stable.  Usually, I always go with the machine's choice, but at the end of the day, the course is supposed to be for humans @@StartBracket@@though I think machines would also like it@@EndBracket@@. }
7... Bg7
{ The development of the kingside needs to be completed, before deciding on the further course of action. }
8. h3
{ We prepare a stable outpost for our bishop on e3, as not to get hit by ...Ng4. }
8... O-O 9. Be3
{ This is a tabia. We have successfully developed our light pieces and are ready to face whatever comes our way.  Black has a wide choice of options. The tempting plans with ...f5 are quite unrealistic, trading the bishops with ...Be6 is not very inspired and perhaps the best he can do is gain some space in the center with the ...c7-c5-push, after either ...Na5, which gains a tempo, but misplaces the knight, or ...Ne7, which is a better square for the knight, but doesn't gain Black a tempo. }
9... Be6
{ This is quite a poor move from a positional viewpoint. The bishop on g7 but also the softened g6- and h6-pawns will not look very good after the trade with  10.Bxe6  fxe6  .  It has been played by the two strongest players who have reached this position so far, though - Bassem Amin and Ivan Saric. }
10. Bxe6 fxe6
{ Now we transposed into a fresh game Dubov-Kamsky, Online blitz 2021, where Daniil handled the opening very convincingly. }
11. a5
{ Daniil included a4-a5 & ...a7-a6 and I guess why not. There are some pros and cons with fixing the queenside structure this way, but they are too minor at this point.  The upside is that we gain space, but the downside is that the ...b4-b5-push becomes hard now and the c6-knight gains some stability. }
11... a6 12. Ne2
{ An almost automatic manoeuvre, once the pawn appeared on e6, as the knight has no more business aiming at the d5-square.  The knight, therefore, moves over to g3, freeing up the space for the c-pawn to guard the d4-square with c2-c3. }
12... Nh5
{ Trying to play on the f-file, even though Black doesn't have too many prospects for any real attack. }
13. c3
{ I believe @@StartBracket@@or rather my strong computers believe@@EndBracket@@ that the exchange sacrifice is not correct here, but it is also possible to start with  13.Nh2  , to play it extra safe. }
13... Rxf3 14. gxf3
{ We will reinforce our kingside with some healthy moves like Ng3 and Kg2 if necessary and it doesn't look like Black will have enough compensation here. As soon as the knight appears on f4, we will chop it off. Let's see a natural sample line. }

{ Black is trying to create some play, but he has very limited resources for the attack, with Qg5-Qh5 being the only idea. }
18. Kh1
{ This is the simplest way to diffuse Black's attack.   18.Nd4!  might objectively be even 'more winning', but it needs strong follow up. One line goes  18...Qg5+  19.Kh2  Qh5  20.Nxe6  Nxf3+  21.Kg2  Nh4+  22.Kh1  f3  23.Qb3  Kh7  24.Nxg7  Kxg7  25.Qxb7  and the queen comes back to defense.   With  18.Kh1  we just prepare Ng1, even at the cost of a pawn. }

6... Nxe5 7. dxe5 Nxc3 8. bxc3
{ Previously, this is how the games would go: Black would try to block the e5-pawn with ...Be6, get the ...f7-f5-push in, hoping that this would neutralize White's kingside majority and there would be nothing to worry about.  It turned out, however, that the strong protected passed e5-pawn gives White more space and a long-term edge, while Black's queenside pawns are targets and his lack of space as well as lack of counterplay makes the position very unpleasant and hard to play.  We will see how this manifests itself in concrete variations in this chapter, but also in the model games, where we can see how White can eventually break through this optically solid position that Black has. }
8... Be7
{ This is the old move, when Black tried to just finish his development and assumed that if the kingside majority can be neutralized with ...f7-f5 after f2-f4, then there would be nothing to fear.  A couple of years ago, players have realized that there is more to it and that Black's dangers of a much deeper, more long-term nature.  I will give show here the start of games Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov, but in the model games section, I will analyze the two games to the end. It is important not only to see how to tie down your opponent but also how to clinch it in the end. }
9. O-O O-O 10. f4
{ There is no need to beat around the bush. We are happy to include f2-f4 and ...f7-f5, so let's do it. }
10... f5 11. Be3
{ An important position to understand and the one you are likely to face if your opponent is not up to date on the latest trends at the highest level, as Black just made all the natural moves this far and has a very solid position, at least optically.  So why is White better? The answer must lie in the pawn structure, though not in the 'doubled pawns are bad' sense, but in a much more nuanced analysis of it.  The protected passed pawn on e5 gives us more space and thus more room to manoeuvre the bishops. Black's d5- as well as b7-pawn, are going to be targeted on the semi-open b- and d-files.  The advance ...c5, while closing the diagonal for the e3-bishop, will weaken the d5-pawn further.  After putting Black onto the defensive with Be2-Bf3, followed by a4-a5, White can then eventually prepare a breakthrough on the kingside with g2-g4 or in the center with the c3-c4-push.  Black, on the other hand, lacks counterplay. The ...g5-break, which is what Shirov tried, backfires due to the king's safety.  On the queenside, the doubled c-pawns are doing a good job at restricting Black's attempts to expand with ...b5 or the ...d5-d4-push, which are pretty much never feasible.  Let's now see how that manifests itself in the concrete moves. }

17... b6 18. Qe1
{ Very subtle, perhaps allowing the possibility of Bf2-Bh4.   Of course,  18.Be2  is a perfectly fine move order as well. }
18... Kh8 19. Be2 { Rerouting to f3, as expected. } 19... Rg8
{ The central push ...d5-d4 often seems as though it opens the position for White's benefit, as the protected passed e5-pawn may gain in strength with the center coming open. As a consequence, Black is looking for counterplay on the kingside, but as in Carlsen-Shirov game, the ...g5-push is also likely to backfire, as the black king ends up weaker than its counterpart on h1. }
20. Bf3 { Pressuring the d5-pawn.   20.a5!  was strong too. } 20... Rad8 21. a5
{ A well-timed push. } 21... b5 22. a6
{ Fixing the a7-pawn, for later, but also isolating the b5-pawn, that can now come under pressure.  Black is getting outplayed here and the full game Vitiugov-So World Cup 2019, deserves its place in the model games section. The threat is now to just pile up on the b5-pawn and it is surprisingly hard to meet. }

{ This system has gained in popularity quite a lot recently. I first noticed it before there have been many fresh high-level games, particularly, because I noticed the computers favoring White a lot, which was surprising, given that White ruins his queenside pawn structure for no immediately obvious benefits.  A while after that a few model games have been played, such as Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov and everyone has realized that there is quite some strategic danger for Black, in these positions.  The idea is that White wants to get rid of the strong e4-knight and the doubled c-pawns will do a decent job at stopping counterplay in the center and the queenside.  White, on the other hand, thanks to our pawn on e5 @@StartBracket@@after ...Nxe5 dxe5@@EndBracket@@ and a kingside majority, has good chances to develop play on the kingside.   I will examine three different concepts for Black here:  • Black taking both the knights,   • Black taking the e5-knight, but not the c3-knight:  6...Nxe5  7.dxe5  Bb4  ,   • Black taking the c3-knight, but not the e5-knight:  6...Nxc3  7.bxc3  Bd6  or  7...c5  . }
6... Nxe5 7. dxe5 Nxc3 8. bxc3
{ Previously, this is how the games would go: Black would try to block the e5-pawn with ...Be6, get the ...f7-f5-push in, hoping that this would neutralize White's kingside majority and there would be nothing to worry about.  It turned out, however, that the strong protected passed e5-pawn gives White more space and a long-term edge, while Black's queenside pawns are targets and his lack of space as well as lack of counterplay makes the position very unpleasant and hard to play.  We will see how this manifests itself in concrete variations in this chapter, but also in the model games, where we can see how White can eventually break through this optically solid position that Black has. }
8... Be7
{ This is the old move, when Black tried to just finish his development and assumed that if the kingside majority can be neutralized with ...f7-f5 after f2-f4, then there would be nothing to fear.  A couple of years ago, players have realized that there is more to it and that Black's dangers of a much deeper, more long-term nature.  I will give show here the start of games Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov, but in the model games section, I will analyze the two games to the end. It is important not only to see how to tie down your opponent but also how to clinch it in the end. }
9. O-O O-O 10. f4
{ There is no need to beat around the bush. We are happy to include f2-f4 and ...f7-f5, so let's do it. }
10... f5 11. Be3
{ An important position to understand and the one you are likely to face if your opponent is not up to date on the latest trends at the highest level, as Black just made all the natural moves this far and has a very solid position, at least optically.  So why is White better? The answer must lie in the pawn structure, though not in the 'doubled pawns are bad' sense, but in a much more nuanced analysis of it.  The protected passed pawn on e5 gives us more space and thus more room to manoeuvre the bishops. Black's d5- as well as b7-pawn, are going to be targeted on the semi-open b- and d-files.  The advance ...c5, while closing the diagonal for the e3-bishop, will weaken the d5-pawn further.  After putting Black onto the defensive with Be2-Bf3, followed by a4-a5, White can then eventually prepare a breakthrough on the kingside with g2-g4 or in the center with the c3-c4-push.  Black, on the other hand, lacks counterplay. The ...g5-break, which is what Shirov tried, backfires due to the king's safety.  On the queenside, the doubled c-pawns are doing a good job at restricting Black's attempts to expand with ...b5 or the ...d5-d4-push, which are pretty much never feasible.  Let's now see how that manifests itself in the concrete moves. }
11... c5
{ Played by Shirov. Carlsen right away shifted the bishop to target the d5-pawn. }
12. Be2 Be6 13. a4
{ Carlsen started with  13.Bf3  , but it is better to avoid the option of ...b5. }
13... Qd7 14. Bf3
{ Now we are back to Carlsen-Shirov, having inversed the moves a4 and Bf3. }
14... Rad8 15. Qe2 { Freeing the way for the f1-rook. } 15... Qc7 16. Rfb1
{ Eyeing the b7-pawn. } 16... b6 17. Rd1
{ Now that ...Qa5 is no longer possible, Carlsen places the rook on d1 after all - focusing on stopping any sort of counterplay with ...d5-d4.   The more direct  17.a5!  was good too, even though Carlsen chose a more conceptual approach. }
17... g5
{ Black is pretty desperate at this point, as he can't also hope to survive this if he just stands passively. The problem now is, however, that his king is weaker than the White's king in the long run. }
18. h3
{ Preventing ...g4. White maintains a significant advantage and the full game can and should be found in the model games section. }

10. Rb1
{ We want to include  10.Rb1  b6  for  11.Qh5  to be more dangerous. The rook is also universally useful on the semi-open b-file. }
10... Re8 { This is a fine neutral move that Black can make. } 11. Re1
{ Guarding the e5-pawn, but also preparing Be3, which is usually an essential part of our plan in these positions, as we trade his active bishop and want to set our kingside majority to motion @@StartBracket@@or create a protected passer after f2-f4 and ...f7-f5@@EndBracket@@. }
11... b6 { Stabilizing the b-pawn and freeing the c8-bishop from its duty. }
12. Qf3

12... Be6 13. Be3
{ Attempting to trade the active c5-bishop, something we usually want to do in these positions. }
13... Qe7
{ Keeping the tension is smart.   Now we can play  14.Bd4!?  intending 15.Qe3 or keep making useful moves, waiting for Black to take on e3. }
14. h3

If Black now takes on e3, we will recapture with the queen and be ready to set the f-pawn in motion.  If Black keeps waiting, we can continue the waiting strategy as well, with moves like Kh2, or we can also lose our patience and go Qg3, intending f2-f4, but then of course after ...Bxe3 Qxe3 we lost half a tempo @@StartBracket@@which though is not a big deal either@@EndBracket@@. }
