At the same time, with the light-squared bishops gone, the ...g4-push is also less dangerous for us. } 10. a5 { We can include a4-a5 and ...a7-a6 now, fixing the queenside pawn structure for good. } 10... a6 { Black should limit our expansion. } 11.

Finally, I went with the direct  16.b4  , because why not, but I will mention the other ones as well.   A thematic pawn sac  16.e5!?  Nxe5  17.b4  is definitely something to consider, keeping the center closed and going for the direct attack.

Qe7 { Accurate, provoking Bc5. } 19. Bc5 { The direct  19.b5  is not as good here, as after Black picks up the exchange on a1  19...Bxa1  20.Rxa1  and takes on b5  20...axb5  21.Qxb5  , he will have the option of  21...Qb4!  . } 19... Qf7 20. Rab1 Rxd1+ 21. Rxd1 Rd8 { Black is in time to trade the rooks. } 22. Rxd8+ Kxd8 23. Nd2 { We are going to regain the pawn and establish a beautiful knight on e4. Our edge is small but lasting.  There were alternatives to explore on move 16, though, as I mentioned, given Black's good defense was hard to fully crack. } *

The pawn on e4 plays little role, while our majority on the kingside has a lot of potential. } 13... dxe4 14. Be3 { Not fearing the endgame, in which we keep our trumps and can plant a rook on d6. Black has an unpleasant task here of having to deal with the eventual kingside expansion with h3-g4. We have a better pawn structure here and a more useful bishop. } *

White, on the other hand, thanks to our pawn on e5 @@StartBracket@@after ...Nxe5 dxe5@@EndBracket@@ and a kingside majority, has good chances to develop play on the kingside.

Still, not a reason for us to refuse a position like this, against an opening as solid as the Petroff.  Also, White had plenty of interesting options that I mentioned earlier on move 8 and 10 that can be eventually investigated. } *

So why is White better? The answer must lie in the pawn structure, though not in the 'doubled pawns are bad' sense, but in a much more nuanced analysis of it.  The protected passed pawn on e5 gives us more space and thus more room to manoeuvre the bishops. Black's d5- as well as b7-pawn, are going to be targeted on the semi-open b- and d-files.  The advance ...c5, while closing the diagonal for the e3-bishop, will weaken the d5-pawn further.  After putting Black onto the defensive with Be2-Bf3, followed by a4-a5, White can then eventually prepare a breakthrough on the kingside with g2-g4 or in the center with the c3-c4-push.  Black, on the other hand, lacks counterplay. The ...g5-break, which is what Shirov tried, backfires due to the king's safety.  On the queenside, the doubled c-pawns are doing a good job at restricting Black's attempts to expand with ...b5 or the ...d5-d4-push, which are pretty much never feasible.  Let's now see how that manifests itself in the concrete moves. } 11... Be6 12. a4 { A good move to start with.

But we really aren't going to rush it. First, we should reroute the bishop to f3. } 16... Qc7 17. Qf2 { A typical retreat, guarding the d4-square one more time and introducing the thematic bishop regroup Be2-Bf3, from where the bishop will apply pressure on the d5-pawn. } 17... b6 18. Qe1 { Very subtle, perhaps allowing the possibility of Bf2-Bh4.   Of course,  18.Be2  is a perfectly fine move order as well. } 18... Kh8 19. Be2 { Rerouting to f3, as expected. } 19... Rg8 { The central push ...d5-d4 often seems as though it opens the position for White's benefit, as the protected passed e5-pawn may gain in strength with the center coming open. As a consequence, Black is looking for counterplay on the kingside, but as in Carlsen-Shirov game, the ...g5-push is also likely to backfire, as the black king ends up weaker than its counterpart on h1. } 20. Bf3 { Pressuring the d5-pawn.   20.a5!  was strong too. } 20... Rad8 21. a5 { A well-timed push. } 21... b5 22. a6 { Fixing the a7-pawn, for later, but also isolating the b5-pawn, that can now come under pressure.  Black is getting outplayed here and the full game Vitiugov-So World Cup 2019, deserves its place in the model games section. The threat is now to just pile up on the b5-pawn and it is surprisingly hard to meet. } *

Be3 { We are happy to neutralize the c5-bishop and then go for the f4-push next. } 12... b6 13. Bxc5 bxc5 14. c4 { A strong pawn sacrifice. We want to diffuse Black's counterplay and gain access to the e4-square, at the cost of a pawn, which isn't very relevant. } 14... Be6 { Similar is  14...dxc4  15.Be4  . } 15. Qe3 { White can keep ignoring the pawn tension, as ...dxc4 is fundamentally not a threat. } 15... dxc4 16. Be4 { We don't mind having given up a pawn. In fact, we are the ones with the pawn majority. } 16... Bd5 17. f4 { White has a pleasant position here, with the pawn majority on the kingside and Black's funny tripled pawns on the c-file not playing too much of a role. } *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 { The move  3.d4!?  was recently brought back into fashion thanks to many interesting new discoveries. It is one of the main tests against the Petroff Defense.   One advantage of  3.d4  over the classical main move  3.Nxe5  is that many Petroff players still consider the latter to be the main move. } 3... Nxe4 4. Bd3 d5 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6. Nc3 { This system has gained in popularity quite a lot recently. I first noticed it before there have been many fresh high-level games, particularly, because I noticed the computers favoring White a lot, which was surprising, given that White ruins his queenside pawn structure for no immediately obvious benefits.  A while after that a few model games have been played, such as Vitiugov-So and Carlsen-Shirov and everyone has realized that there is quite some strategic danger for Black, in these positions.  The idea is that White wants to get rid of the strong e4-knight and the doubled c-pawns will do a decent job at stopping counterplay in the center and the queenside.  White, on the other hand, thanks to our pawn on e5 @@StartBracket@@after ...Nxe5 dxe5@@EndBracket@@ and a kingside majority, has good chances to develop play on the kingside.   I will examine three different concepts for Black here:  • Black taking both the knights,   • Black taking the e5-knight, but not the c3-knight:  6...Nxe5  7.dxe5  Bb4  ,   • Black taking the c3-knight, but not the e5-knight:  6...Nxc3  7.bxc3  Bd6  or  7...c5  . } 6... Nxe5 7. dxe5 Nxc3 8. bxc3 { Previously, this is how the games would go: Black would try to block the e5-pawn with ...Be6, get the ...f7-f5-push in, hoping that this would neutralize White's kingside majority and there would be nothing to worry about.  It turned out, however, that the strong protected passed e5-pawn gives White more space and a long-term edge, while Black's queenside pawns are targets and his lack of space as well as lack of counterplay makes the position very unpleasant and hard to play.  We will see how this manifests itself in concrete variations in this chapter, but also in the model games, where we can see how White can eventually break through this optically solid position that Black has. } 8... Bc5 { The more active move, compared to  8...Be7  , and the one that is preferred by Petroff theoreticians like Dominguez and Vidit.  Now we will likely end up trading the bishops with an eventual Be3 and this extra trade will bring Black some relief, though not necessarily the full equality. } 9. O-O { It is also interesting to look at the quick  9.Qh5!?  , but I recommend  9.O-O  . } 9... O-O { In this position White has a few options.   The direct  10.Qh5  seems to lead to a slightly better endgame that Black eventually holds after  10...g6  11.Qh6  Re8  12.Bg5  Bf8!  , which occurred in Fier-Vidit and Vachier-Dominguez.   10.Re1  followed by 11.Be3 is a valid approach, but my main recommendation is to start with the universal and useful  10.Rb1!?  , not the least because there are some tricky hidden traps down the line. } 10. Rb1 { We want to include  10.Rb1  b6  for  11.Qh5  to be more dangerous. The rook is also universally useful on the semi-open b-file. } 10... b6 { This is very natural, the inclusion of Rb1 and b6 may seem innocent, but actually, it has quite some impact down the forcing lines after  11.Qh5  . } 11. Qh5 { With the inclusion of @@StartFEN@@r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/2bpP3/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10@@EndFEN@@  10.Rb1  b6  , the endgame that can arise down the line with 12...Re8 is more promising for White. } 11... g6 12. Qh6 Re8 { Going for the endgame now is less desirable for Black @@StartBracket@@than without the Rab1 b6 inclusion@@EndBracket@@, but it is still possible, especially if Black follows it up well. } 13. Bg5 Bf8 14. Bxd8 Bxh6 15. Bxc7 Bd7 16. Ba6 { Black has to work hard here to prove compensation for the pawn. } *
