White enjoys a bit of an edge here and Black is yet to fully neutralize our opening initiative, which is also confirmed by the engines, that just like humans, seem to value good piece coordination.

The topical  7.a4!?  preserves the light-squared bishop too, while it also gains space on the queenside - a factor that engines taught us to appreciate more and more. } 7...

Nbd2 Re8 { This, intending to play ...Be6 and then recapture with the rook, without doubling the pawns is probably the most solid setup one can play against the Italian.  Black wants to trade White's active Italian bishop without creating any weaknesses, hoping to then slowly deal with the issue of the c6-knight, but eventually transferring it over to g6 via e7, with or without the ...d6-d5-break.  White in his turn will push b4 and hope to claim a small but lasting edge, thanks to more space on the queenside and the better-arranged knights. } 11. b4 { This is generally more flexible than starting with  11.Nf1  here. White anyway wants to grab space on the queenside, while the move Nf1 is only one of the options down the road on move 13, as we shall see. } 11... Be6 12. Bxe6 Rxe6 13. Bb2 { I have played this cunning move on various occasions and I have chosen this as my main recommendation.  It is not clear whether the bishop is that well placed on b2 at the moment, as the a1-h8-diagonal is rather closed, but the main purpose of this move is prophylaxis. We are basically bracing for the ...d5-break, after which we intend to start some complications, including an eventual c3-c4 and our bishop activating itself.  The bishop also does a good job defending the c3-pawn in these ...d5-variations and finally, if the c6-knight chooses to go to g6, we can then push c3-c4 and eventually also d3-d4, when our bishop will start looking quite good on the long diagonal. } 13... Qd7 { Is a standard move in this position. White has two interesting options here, I have in fact played both of them. } 14. d4 { The simple  14.Nf1  is also very tempting, now that the  14...d5  -push is no longer on the agenda, thanks to  15.b5!  . } 14... Ree8 { Taking on d4 is suicidal:  14...exd4  15.cxd4  Nxb4  16.d5!  , so this is the only move to maintain a solid position. } 15. Ra3 { The rook is getting ready for action. Eventual action. } 15... Rad8 { The most natural. } 16. Qb1 { The queen is doing a good job exerting control over the important file and diagonal. } 16... Ne7 { Transferring the knight to g6 is always on our opponent's mind. } 17. Nf1 Ng6 18. c4 { Finally, we have opened both our bishop and the rook and now everything is well placed. Black is yet to find a good way to release the tension and equalize. } *

I believe, as is so often the case in the Italian, the ...d6-d5-break does not solve all of Black's problems. } 16. a5 { I like this move, just making sure we avoid any unexpected queenside pawn breaks and have the structure fixed in our favor there.   Alternatively  16.Ng3  d5  and now  17.Bc3!  , improving on what Gustafsson covers and keeping the tension, would lead to similar play as in the sample line I give. As we will see, the ...d5-break is not the end of the variation. } 16... Qe8 { Preparing ...d5, a logical plan suggested by Gustafsson. The engines still give White a small plus, so I decided to look beyond this pawn break. } 17. Ng3 d5 18.

Nf5 { It turns out we have the better knight, as the knight on g6 is tied down to the defense of the e5-pawn, not to mention it could get hit on f4 with Bc1!.

Rd7 23. Kg2 { The king belongs on g2, once the pawn is on g3 and now is a good moment for this essential move. } 23... Red8 24. Rb1 { We can just give up the d-file. Black can't make any particular use of his pawn center, nor of the d-file, and he is the one on the defensive side.  White is the one with the better knights and in the long term there is a Bc1+b4-b5 idea. } *

Bxe6 fxe6 12. b4 { We want to grab that space on the queenside. There is no point for White to postpone this move - in fact, if he does so, Black may very well consider going ...a6-a5!?, preventing the expansion altogether.   After  12.b4  Black can make a bunch of different moves, but essentially the strong players have been choosing from two different plans: one is ...Nh5-Nf4 and the other is ...Ne7-Ng6.   12...Qe8  and  12...Qd7  are just delaying that, while another idea that comes to mind, ...g7-g5, seems more weakening than offensive. } 12... Ne7 { This is a very solid system, that has been played twice by Bacrot, who, being a second of MVL, I suspect is very well versed in the intricacies of the Italian.  This system is somewhat of a hybrid between the ...Ne7-Ng6 and ...Be6-systems. Black wants to reroute the knight to the kingside, not so much to attack there, but rather to free up his c-pawn and eventually start liberating play in the center and the queenside with ...c7-c5 and ...d6-d5.  I wasn't able to find a tangible advantage against this system, not because I hadn't tried, but just because the position is way too solid and healthy for Black.  At the same time, as we will see down the road, Black doesn't get much fun here and is constantly landing himself in drawish, yet very slightly worse positions.   12...Qd7  13.Nf1  There doesn't seem to be too much point to Black's move ...Qd7 without ...Ne7, after which he is likely to eventually transpose to the 12...Ne7-system.   12...Qe8  is a reasonable move and has been played a bunch of times, but mainly with the idea to transpose back into the 12...Nh5 line on the next move.  13.Nf1  Nh5  transposing to 12...Nh5 13.Nf1 Qe8. } 13. Nf1 { The knight should be rerouted.   I tried also  13.d4  ideas, but Black has nicely braced for it with  13...Ng6  , followed by ...Nd7+Qe7 and doubling along the f-file. } 13... Ng6 14. N1h2 { This is a new move.   Magnus has won that famously 'not-so-smooth' game against Etienne after  14.Ra2  , which is a fine flexible move, but I think the text move could be more useful and also easier to understand and follow up.   After  14.Ra2  Etienne improved on his game against Magnus with  14...Qe8!?  keeping the option of ...c7-c5, as well as freeing up the d8-square for the rook.   With  14.N1h2  , I propose to solidify our f3-knight and intend to follow this up with g2-g3+Kg2, taking the f4-square from the g6-knight and getting a very solid and harmonious setup on the kingside.   The point of the knight on h2, in general, is that it does as good a job defending the f3-knight as it does on d2, but it is not in the way of our other pieces, particularly the c1-bishop.  In the long run, of course, there are also Ng4 ideas and the fact that after the h3-h4-push the g4-square is protected is another upside as well.

We want to eliminate Black's strong a7-bishop here. } 17... cxb4 { Black could also keep the tension, when we would do the same or trade on c5 in any case the position is very level, except for the fact that Black has minor long-term weaknesses on e6+e5. } 18. Bxa7 Rxa7 19. cxb4 { The kind of position both sides are probably fine with.  Black is on his way to simplifying the game, but White is also happy to have maintained a stable position, gotten rid of any potential kingside counterplay and is ready to start the next phase of the game, which is to try and exploit the pawn weaknesses on the e-file.  If you don't enjoy this kind of positional pressure, you are missing out. } *

I wasn't able to find a tangible advantage against this system, not because I hadn't tried, but just because the position is way too solid and healthy for Black.

After  14.Ra2  Etienne improved on his game against Magnus with  14...Qe8!?  keeping the option of ...c7-c5, as well as freeing up the d8-square for the rook.

We will then place our other knight on f3 and exert pressure on the e5-pawn. } 19.

After  12.b4  Black can make a bunch of different moves, but essentially the strong players have been choosing from two different plans: one is ...Nh5-Nf4 and the other is ...Ne7-Ng6.   12...Qe8  and  12...Qd7  are just delaying that, while another idea that comes to mind, ...g7-g5, seems more weakening than offensive. } 12... Ne7 { This is a very solid system, that has been played twice by Bacrot, who, being a second of MVL, I suspect is very well versed in the intricacies of the Italian.  This system is somewhat of a hybrid between the ...Ne7-Ng6 and ...Be6-systems. Black wants to reroute the knight to the kingside, not so much to attack there, but rather to free up his c-pawn and eventually start liberating play in the center and the queenside with ...c7-c5 and ...d6-d5.  I wasn't able to find a tangible advantage against this system, not because I hadn't tried, but just because the position is way too solid and healthy for Black.  At the same time, as we will see down the road, Black doesn't get much fun here and is constantly landing himself in drawish, yet very slightly worse positions.   12...Qd7  13.Nf1  There doesn't seem to be too much point to Black's move ...Qd7 without ...Ne7, after which he is likely to eventually transpose to the 12...Ne7-system.   12...Qe8  is a reasonable move and has been played a bunch of times, but mainly with the idea to transpose back into the 12...Nh5 line on the next move.  13.Nf1  Nh5  transposing to 12...Nh5 13.Nf1 Qe8. } 13. Nf1 { The knight should be rerouted.   I tried also  13.d4  ideas, but Black has nicely braced for it with  13...Ng6  , followed by ...Nd7+Qe7 and doubling along the f-file. } 13... Ng6 14. N1h2 { This is a new move.   Magnus has won that famously 'not-so-smooth' game against Etienne after  14.Ra2  , which is a fine flexible move, but I think the text move could be more useful and also easier to understand and follow up.   After  14.Ra2  Etienne improved on his game against Magnus with  14...Qe8!?  keeping the option of ...c7-c5, as well as freeing up the d8-square for the rook.   With  14.N1h2  , I propose to solidify our f3-knight and intend to follow this up with g2-g3+Kg2, taking the f4-square from the g6-knight and getting a very solid and harmonious setup on the kingside.   The point of the knight on h2, in general, is that it does as good a job defending the f3-knight as it does on d2, but it is not in the way of our other pieces, particularly the c1-bishop.  In the long run, of course, there are also Ng4 ideas and the fact that after the h3-h4-push the g4-square is protected is another upside as well.  Now I give a few different sample variations, but in essence, it is all similar. } 14... Qd7 { A natural move. Black wants to push ...c7-c5 but delays it by one move. } 15. g3 { I tried different options, but finally, I prefer this simple move. Going g2-g3 and Kg2 is part of our plan, as we restrict the g6-knight.   I tried something more proactive like  15.d4  or  15.Qb3  /  15.Qc2  first, but somehow these are all empty shots into nothingness.  I propose to just improve our position on the kingside for now and embrace the pawn trades.  At the end of the day, Black can't get rid of his weak e-pawns and we have to cherish that. } 15... c5 { This is part of Black's plan. We play along and simplify. } 16. Be3 cxb4 17. Bxa7 Rxa7 18. cxb4 { We have a small and long-lasting mini edge here, thanks to the weak e-pawns. The knight on g6 is also not happy, being dominated by the g3-pawn. I continue the line a little further. } 18... b5 19. axb5 { We embrace the trades. } 19... axb5 20. Rxa7 Qxa7 21. Qb3 Qd7 22. Kg2 { We have a fine position on our hands, with small pressure.  Black simplified a lot but still has his doubled e-pawns. His knights are passive and next we want to start looking for a way to put pressure.  I propose to keep the idea of Ng4 in mind, but mainly the e1-rook is the one piece that can be easily improved and sent on a mission along one of the open files on the queenside.  Sometimes also the d3-d4-break is there, if the circumstances are good, though mainly I would hope for Black to push ...d6-d5 himself, weakening the e5-pawn as well. } *

If Black just wants to go for ...Be6 systems, he could go for  7...Ba7  ,  delaying castling, which would anyway discourage Bg5 and play ...h6 at a later occasion after White has played h3 first.   7...O-O  8.Re1  h6   playing  8...a5  here can lead to a particularly dangerous version of the Bg5 variation for Black, but after  9.h3  Vishy went  9...h6  against me and we transposed anyway.  9.h3  leads us back to the main move 7...h6. } 8. Re1 O-O 9. h3 { This fits in well with our concept of not closing the c1-bishop too early with Nbd2 and is in particular important for us: we want to be able to meet  9...a5  with  10.d4!? } 9... a5 { This is the reason for playing this move order as Black. Of course, he can still choose other plans, for example, ...Be6 or ...Re8+Be6, but that is dealt with in other chapters, through the other move order 7... Ba7.   The point of  9...a5!?  and the reason why Black essentially has provoked the move a2-a4 is that he wants to meet the automatic  10.Nbd2  with  10...Be6  and  11.Bb5  with  11...Na7!  , when White doesn't have the move Ba4. This sounds way too smart to be good, but actually, it's a pretty decent system and the engines are not at all against it! } 10. d4 { Grabbing the center, no-nonsense. When I was studying the Italian with my team back in 2019, this was our idea for this line and I got to use it against Sergey Karjakin. I got a crushing position in no time, though unfortunately, went on to lose for reasons unrelated to the opening.   Anyway, back to the position on the board! Black has an important choice to make now:  10...Ba7  or  10...Bb6  ? The differences are very subtle. } 10... Bb6 { Anand has later played this move too, so it is not a bad one. In some lines, guarding the c7-square is quite important, but there are also lines where the bishop would be better placed on a7, so it is not all one-sided. } 11. Bb3 { Here it is a novelty, but obviously, since I played the same concept against Ba7, it doesn't really count as such. The idea is again to protect the e4-pawn. Unfortunately, we are not able to do it with the b1-knight and must resort to finesses. } 11... Re8 12. Bc2 { The pawns are protected. Black has a choice now: to give up the fight for the central squares and go for the bishop pair or to keep the tension. } 12... exd4 { The tempting reaction, to go for the bishop, with ...Nb4 next. } 13. cxd4 Nb4 14. Nc3 { We are happy with our pawn center and our knights protecting it beautifully. We are sad to see our c2-bishop go, but you can't have it all, if the opponent is not a complete noob. } 14... Nxc2 15. Qxc2 { Whether the bishop is on b6 or a7, I believe the nature of the position is the same. White just wants to get the c1-bishop and the a1-rook towards the center, while Black is hoping to stir up some action before White mobilizes his forces fully. } 15... d5 { This option is even more tempting with the bishop on b6, because Black doesn't lose the pawn. However, there is a downside to having the bishop on b6 too. } 16. e5 Ne4 17. Be3 { Here  17.Nxe4  Bf5  18.Nf6+  is pointless, as after  18...Qxf6  ,  the c7-pawn is no longer hanging. But now we can just reinforce our dark squares and work against the ...c5-break, which is what Black desires. } 17... Bf5 18. Nd2 { We are challenging the e4-knight and with it, the control over the dark squares c5 and d4. } 18... c5 19. dxc5 { Had the bishop been on a7 Black would have a smart tactic with ...Ng3! and ...d4! next, but now he also has to deal with a hanging bishop on b6. } 19... Bc7 { Now  20.f4  allows  20...Ng3  followed by ...d4 with a mess, but instead, I propose a simple sequence leading to a small but very stable plus. } 20. Ndxe4 Bxe5 { This is the point. } 21. Rad1 { We are happy to give back the pawn and just want our dark square domination. } 21... Bxc3 22. Qxc3 Rxe4 23. Bd4 { To be very honest, I tend to overestimate such beautiful one-sided positions, but I do believe that White has very good chances to make something out of this.  Our bishop has a brighter future and our queenside pawn structure is somewhat superior as well. A solid plus equal, as we say. } *

Ba2. } 10... h6 { Now  11.d4  is not attractive, due to  11...Bb7  12.Be3  and now Black has the  12...exd4  13.cxd4  Nb4!  manoeuvre with our e4-pawn being in some trouble. } 11. Nbd2 { The knight is heading towards g3 most likely. } 11... b4 { Now that White can't meet this with 12. d4, it is quite well-timed. } 12. Nf1 { Also interesting is  12.Nc4!?  , avoiding the potential staredown of the light-squared bishops. } 12... Be6 { White doesn't have anything major here, but I believe just trading both pairs of bishops here gives us a pleasant position. } 13. Bxe6 fxe6 14. Be3 { It is a question of whether the ...b5-b4 expansion has brought Black all too much. In fact, he has also exposed his weak a6-pawn, which could be relevant in the future.  He will likely be able to trade along the open b-file or control it, but that doesn't solve his main problem - the fact that White has a better pawn structure, as we always have the d3-d4-push in reserve. } 14... Bxe3 { There are many alternatives on this and next moves, but the nature of the position doesn't change and I will just give a sample line. } 15. Rxe3 Rb8 { The rook will likely be useful on the open file. It is also clever by Black to keep ...bxc3 in reserve for now. } 16. d4 { Reasonable timing for this push, but we could also prepare it, for example with  16.N1d2!?  . Now that the queenside may come open, a knight on that side of the board can come in handy. } 16... bxc3 17. bxc3 { It isn't much, but I believe White's position is to be preferred, with somewhat more space in the center and with Black just having a few minor weaknesses, such as the e6- and a6-pawns, that can make an impact in the long run.  In the short run, however, we want to employ our f1-knight. It could, of course, go to g3, but with the b-file open and the a6-pawn potentially being a target, the d2-square looks attractive as well, with the knight potentially heading to c4. } *

An important thing to note is that if Black wants to play this ...Nh5 move, he has to do it without trading on e3, because of the Nxe5 tactic. } 12.

True, Black gets a 'good' pawn structure, but White gets too much piece play for it. } 14. cxd4 d5 15. exd5 Nexd5 16. Ne4 { MVL went for  16.b5  , but this is more challenging, trading one pair of knights and activating pieces quickly. } 16... Nb6 { Black chases our bishop away from its active position, but it will now shift to the other diagonal, where it is also rather annoying. } 17. Bd3 Be6 18. Qd1 Nxe4 19. Bxe4 Nd5 { If  19...Bd5  we keep the bishops with  20.Bc2!  and retain our attacking ideas. } 20. Ra3 { Activating the rook along the third rank, potentially after Ne5. I love it. } 20... c6 { This is a typical solidifying move, intending to meet  21.Ne5  with  21...Nf6!  . } 21. Bb1 { A very strong retreat. Qc2 is a threat now, while  21...Nxb4?  is losing to the  22.Bxh6!  blow. } 21... Nxb4 22. Bxh6 gxh6 23. Qd2 { Eyeing the h6-pawn as well as the b4-knight. With the king so weak, Black is lost. } *

O-O a6 { This is the traditional way of playing the Italian. Black gives room to the bishop on c5 and creates a positional threat of ...Na5, now that the b5-square is taken. } 7. a4 { White has to address the ...Na5 threat with the traditional move  7.Bb3  or the modern  7.a4!  .   After  7.Bb3  White would play Nbd2, h2-h3 and Re1, intending to bring the knight to g3 with Nd2-f1-g3. Black found different setups that are acceptable against this.   The topical  7.a4!?  preserves the light-squared bishop too, while it also gains space on the queenside - a factor that engines taught us to appreciate more and more. } 7... Ba7 { For us, it doesn't matter whether Black starts with  7...O-O  or  7...Ba7  , but most players choose this one, as it works better against  8.Bg5  . } 8. Re1 O-O 9. h3 { This is important. While there are many different orders, combining Re1 and Nbd2 without h2-h3 would be a serious inaccuracy as it allows ...Ng4!:  9.Nbd2  Ng4!  10.Re2  Kh8!  11.h3  f5!  and Black is having quite some fun at our expense. } 9... h6 10.
