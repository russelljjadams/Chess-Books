{ Evaluate the position and suggest a plan for White.  @@HeaderStart@@Jorge Cori Tello – Hrant Melkumyan, Moscow 2012@@HeaderEnd@@  We have a Carlsbad structure where White has played b2-b3 instead of the more usual c2-c3. In Chapter 5 we studied an identical structure in the game Wojtaszek – Khairullin, but with reversed colours. According to that game, Black’s plans should be based on playing ...a7-a5, ...b6-b5-b4 and then either ...Ba6 to trade bishops and pressure c2, or break in the centre with ...e6-e5.    As the reader may notice, neither plan works here. Despite the level appearance of the position, Black experiences some difficulties already because he lacks a plan. The game continued: } 1. Qe2 Rc8 2. f4 Qc7 3. Rf2 Ng6 4. g3 Qe7 5. h4 { Beginning a kingside attack; note how Black simply marks time. } 5... Rfe8 { Or  16...Qd8  17.h5  Ne7  18.g4 !  preventing ...Nf5; there is no counterplay and White may prepare a kingside assault for as long as he needs to. } 6. h5 Nf8 7. g4 N6d7 8. g5 { An excellent decision that entails a strong pawn sacrifice; Black’s forces are paralyzed. } 8... Bxe5 { This accelerates defeat.   Sturdier was waiting with  19...Rc7  though after  20.Qe3  Rec8  21.Ndf3  Qe8  22.Rg2  ± the eventual g5-g6 break will be strong. } 9. fxe5 { This is the point – the g5-pawn can be sacrificed.
