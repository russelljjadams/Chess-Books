White’s post-opening play was imprecise; it was clear that Black was planning ...f7-f5 hence 16.Rfc1 was out of place.  2. The key to Black’s 17...Qe7 is to prepare ...f7-f5 so that it is not so easy for White to play f3-f4 driving away the bishop on e5, as we see in the variation 15...f5. If White cannot play f3-f4 after the trade on f5, then Black is likely to have at least enough counterplay. } *

The truth is, this plan is often good enough to gain a tiny advantage, but the game can become oversimplified rather easily. Nevertheless, we should remember the Maroczy structure often gives better chances to White.

White’s plan of f3-f4 and the resulting position proved to be very promising, as both e4-e5 and f4-f5 were potentially strong breaks. White unfortunately missed two great opportunities to play a strong f4-f5 break.  2. Black’s problem in this game was his lack of precision in critical moments. It would have helped to play ...e7-e6 to prevent White’s knight from coming to d5, where it created threats and especially allowed the f4-f5 break. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Asymmetric Benoni@@HeaderEnd@@  The asymmetric Benoni structure, usually called simply the Benoni, is a very tactical pawn structure that requires great precision from both sides. It typically arises from various Benoni openings, though it also appears in many variations of the Ruy Lopez. The main theme in this structure is the fight between pawn majorities. White has a pawn majority in the centre while Black has his majority on the queenside. The side that manages to push his majority will generally achieve a superior position, and all plans gravitate around this fact. White enjoys some spatial advantage, therefore trading pieces will often work against him. In fact, as pieces are traded, Black's position often becomes better. The reason is that Black has the potential for creating a remote passed pawn, which can be very strong in an endgame. In contrast, White's chances are at their best in a middlegame with many pieces still on the board, since the central majority often provides him with good chances for a mating attack.   Now let's spell out specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. Break in the centre with e4-e5, either to obtain an attack or to create a central passed pawn.  2. Break with e4-e5 followed by f4-f5 in order to obtain a kingside attack.  3. Break with f4-f5 followed by a kingside attack, mainly down the f-file.  4. Prevent Black's queenside expansion by playing b2-b4, blocking the advance ...b5-b4.  Black's plans  1. Advance the queenside majority with ...b7-b5, ...c5-c4, ...b5-b4, etc. Create a passed pawn if possible.  2. Pressure down the e-file, preventing White from advancing his central majority.  3. Create kingside counterplay based on ...h7-h5-h4, mainly when White has placed a knight on g3.  4. Break White's centre with ...f7-f5. This break can work wonderfully after White has played f3-f4 since the d5-pawn loses protection.  As we will see later in this chapter, Black's light-squared bishop is often the least helpful piece, as it does not contribute to the advance of the majority, and it is often blocked by the queenside pawns on a6-b5-c4. The first three games in this chapter illustrate White's Plans 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Then we use a short fragment to discuss Black's piece arrangement, and at the same time present White's Plan 4. Then the last two examples display a combination of Black's Plans 1 and 4. } 1. -- *

White’s bishop on f4 proved very useful, as it provoked Black to develop his bishop on the unnatural e7-square.  2. The central break would have been much stronger if White had not traded his dark-squared bishop.  3. Trading pieces often decreases the power of a potential e4-e5 break. For this reason Black had a great chance to equalize with the natural 17...Nb6. It often helps Black to trade off those pieces supporting the e4-e5 break.  4. After the break was achieved, Black’s position became very difficult and just one mistake was enough for it to collapse. Nevertheless, even with the best defence, White’s attack was very promising. } *

Something to learn from this game is how delicate this structure is. If Black had only played the intermediate 16...h4 he would have had a somewhat superior position. Instead, the imprecise 16...b5 gave White a decisive attack.  2. White’s attacking scheme with e4-e5 followed by f4-f5 is often strong, but not always as effective as in this example. Black’s problem here was having played ...h7-h5  (weakening g6)  in addition to the white bishop’s presence on the b1-h7 diagonal, which added pressure to the g6-pawn. } *

{ The position in the diagram occurred in the game Mikhalevski – Guseinov, Novi Sad 2009. Black’s pieces are arranged ideally. The bishop on g7 has a long range of action supporting the queenside expansion. Meanwhile, Black’s knights combine the tasks of preventing White’s expansion and pressuring the e4-pawn. However, the reader may notice Black’s coordination would be disrupted if he had a light-squared bishop. Where could this bishop go?

The reader should notice how Black did not clarify the situation in the centre until he had played ...Na6-c7 and was ready to trade some minor pieces. These two elements are helpful in this structure, hence Black’s opening strategy proved effective in this regard.  2. One of Black’s most memorable ideas in this game is 15...b6 followed by 17...Ba6 and 19...Bc4, to obtain activity for the light-squared bishop and ultimately trade this piece and only then push the queenside majority.  3. White’s biggest mistake was the reckless 24.f4, undermining the otherwise healthy f3-e4-d5 pawn chain. Black’s 25...f5 reply was rather obvious and very strong; it is a break to remember. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Johan Hellsten – Emilio Cordova, Buenos Aires 2006@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game illustrates how Black may combine chances of kingside and queenside play after breaking in the centre with ...f7-f5. } 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Nge2 Bg7 8. Ng3 a6 9. a4 { Preventing ...b7-b5. } 9... h5 { This is typical when White’s knight is on g3. Black may later play ...h5-h4 to claim some space on the kingside and pressure the e4-pawn. } 10. Be2 Nbd7 11. Bg5 Qc7 12. O-O O-O 13. Qd2 Re8 14. f3 { This move serves two purposes: it supports the e4-pawn and it frees the f2-square for the future Ng3-h1-f2 manoeuvre. } 14... Nh7 15. Be3 Ne5 16. Nh1 { So far both sides have followed the standard plans for this position. White now begins the typical manoeuvre Nh1-f2 to further support his centre and perhaps prepare the f3-f4 and e4-e5 advance. } 16... Bd7 17. Nf2 { It is not a good idea to play:  17.f4 ?!  Ng4  18.Bxg4  Bxg4  19.Nf2   instead  19.f5 ?  threatening h2-h3, runs into  19...Bxf5 !  20.exf5  Rxe3  ∓  21.Qxe3 ??

If  17.h3  (threatening f3-f4 trapping the knight)  then  17...b5 !  allows Black to unleash his forces on the queenside after:  18.axb5  axb5  19.Nxb5  Bxb5  20.Bxb5  Rxa1  21.Rxa1  Rb8  22.Bf1   or  22.Ra5  Rxb5 !  23.Rxb5  Nc4  24.Qc1  Nxe3  ∞  25.Qxe3 ??  Bd4  -+  22...Rxb2 !  This is the key move. After  23.Qd1  Qb7  it is White who must fight for equality, as the c5-pawn can advance and become a dangerous threat. } 17... f5 { A standard rupture in this position, claiming space on the kingside and pressing against White’s centre.   Now the usual  17...b5 ?!  does not work as well due to  18.axb5  axb5  19.Nxb5  Bxb5  20.Bxb5  Rxa1  21.Rxa1  Rb8  22.Ra5 !  when White is just in time to maintain the extra pawn. } 18. h3 { This is probably intended to cover the g4-square, preparing the f3-f4 advance. Unfortunately for White, the weakening of the g3-square is a far more important issue.   Probably better is  18.exf5  gxf5  19.Nh3  followed by  Nf4  with a good position, due to the weakness of the h5-pawn and the e6-square. } 18... h4 { A double-edged yet standard decision in this position. Black gains control of the g3-square, but the h4-pawn may become weak in some cases.   An alternative was  18...Nf6  19.exf5   or  19.f4  Nf7 =  19...gxf5  20.Rac1  Qa5  with level chances. } 19. Rae1 Qa5 { Threatening ...b7-b5 advancing the queenside majority. } 20. Ra1 { Preventing ...b7-b5 for now. } 20... Rab8 { Of course not:  20...b5 ?  21.axb5  +- } 21. Qc2 { The last three moves are evidence of Black’s success with ...f7-f5. Without the possibility of expanding on the kingside, White finds himself marking time due to the lack of targets to attack. } 21... Nf6 { Slowly heading to the g3-square via h5. } 22. Bg5 Nf7 { This is one of my favourite moves in the game, and the reader should pay close attention to it. Black has advanced with ...h7-h5-h4 gaining control of the g3-square. White reacts with the usual Bg5 intending to capture this pawn, but Black’s move presents him with a dilemma: can he really capture the pawn? } 23. Bd2 { This natural-looking move is a serious mistake. By not accepting the challenge, White cedes the initiative and his position becomes extremely uncomfortable due to the lack of targets.   Necessary was the capture:  23.Bxh4  f4   An alternative is:  23...g5 !?  24.Bg3  f4  25.Bh2  Nh5  ∞  After the text move, Black is threatening  ...g6-g5  trapping the bishop, so now the best continuation is:  24.Nd3   If  24.Bxf6  Bxf6  Black’s control of the dark squares gives him a good position despite being a pawn down.   Or  24.Ng4 ?!  Nxg4  25.hxg4  Be5  =+ when Black obtains a dangerous attack after  ...Kg7  and  ...Rh8.  24...c4  25.Nc1  Nh5 !?  Black has good compensation for the pawn, as he can continue to advance on the queenside with  ...b7-b5-b4  , while White’s kingside attempts are currently on standby. } 23... Nh5 { Heading to the strong g3-square. } 24. exf5 { The opening of the e-file only benefits Black.   Better was  24.Bd3  Ng3  25.Rfe1  Qc7  26.Bf1  b5  =+ when White has a very uncomfortable position. } 24... gxf5 { Of course Black should recapture with the pawn to cover the key e4-square. } 25. Bd3 Ng3 { Black achieves a dream position for this pawn structure. His queenside majority has strong potential and may soon begin to advance. Meanwhile, his kingside pawns on f5 and h4, together with the strong knight on g3, are enough to neutralize all of White’ efforts to create counterplay in this sector. } 26. Nce4 { Hoping to trade the knight on g3.   A somewhat better defence was  26.Ncd1  Qd8  27.Ne3  hoping to gain activity on the kingside, but after:  27...Qf6 !   instead  27...Nxf1 ?!  28.Rxf1  Nh6  29.Nxf5  Bxf5  30.Bxf5  Nxf5  31.Qxf5  Qf6  32.Qh5  gives White some counterplay  28.Bc3  Qg6  29.Rfe1  Bxc3  30.bxc3   or  30.Qxc3  Ne5  ∓  30...Qg5  ∓ Black dominates the board. } 26... Qb6 { A strong move, preventing White’s plan. Black’s advantage becomes decisive.   Instead  26...Qc7 ?  allows White to solve his problems after  27.Nxg3  hxg3  28.Nd1  since the f5- and g3-pawns are weak, and the strong knight on  g3  is off the board. } 27. Nc3 { Instead  27.Nxg3 ?  loses a piece after  27...hxg3  28.Nd1  c4+ } 27... Qc7 { Black does not even bother to trade his strong knight for the passive rook on f1. He plays according to the spirit of this structure, intending to advance the queenside majority with ...c5-c4, and ...b7-b5-b4.   Even stronger was:  27...Bd4 !  28.Rad1  c4 !  29.Bxc4  Rbc8  30.Bd3  Ne5  -+ White’s position is desperate because he cannot release his pieces, for example:  31.Bg5 ?  Bxa4 !  32.Qxa4  Nxd3  33.Rxd3  Bxf2+  34.Rxf2  Re1+  35.Kh2  Rh1# } 28. Rfe1 { Freeing the f1-square for the bishop, which would otherwise be lost after ...c5-c4.   28.Rfd1  doesn’t help:  28...c4  29.Bf1  Qc5  30.Bc1  b5  and the advance of the queenside majority is decisive.   Or  28.Rad1 ?  c4  when the bishop is lost.   Preventing  ...c5-c4  with  28.b3  is not effective after  28...b5  29.axb5  axb5  30.Rac1  and now the simple  30...b4 !?   or the more ambitious  30...c4 !  31.Ncd1  Ne5  with a crushing queenside attack  31.Na2  Nxf1  32.Rxf1  Qc8  is easily winning for Black. } 28... c4 29. Ncd1 { The alternative  29.Bf1  is similar to the game after  29...Bd4  30.Ncd1  b5  31.Bc3  Rxe1  32.Bxe1  Qc5  -+ when White’s forces are completely tied up. } 29... b5 { Of course not:  29...cxd3 ??  30.Qxc7  +- } 30. axb5 axb5 31. Bf1 Qc5 32. Rxe8+ Rxe8 33. Bc3 b4 { Black does not even bother to capture the d5-pawn; he has bigger goals in mind. } 34. Bxg7 Re1 { A great final blow! White resigns. There is no satisfactory defence against the threat of mate in three.   For example:  35.Bf6   or  35.Ne3  Rxa1  36.Qd2  Kxg7  35...Rxf1+  36.Kh2  Rh1+ !  37.Nxh1  Nf1#  Final remarks  1. The critical moment in the game was after the move 22...Nf7, and White’s biggest mistake was not to accept the challenge with 23.Bxh4.   2. Once Black gained the initiative there was little White could do to fight back. This is often the case in the Benoni structure; the position is difficult to hold once Black’s queenside majority begins its march.  3. Black’s ...f7-f5 break is often well met by exf5 followed by a knight transfer to f4  (and possibly e6)  . If White does not take advantage of Black’s vulnerable king, then he is likely to fall into a passive position, as in this game. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Symmetric Benoni@@HeaderEnd@@  The symmetric Benoni structure is one of my favourites, and it is one of the structures that motivated me to write this book. It often arises from Benoni variations in which White recaptures exd5 instead of cxd5, which yields the more typical Benoni position we studied in the previous chapter. Unlike the previous chapter in which Black had clear plans to gain counterplay, now Black faces a dilemma of what to do. Black can often develop his pieces to obtain what seems to be an equal position, but White usually retains a small spatial advantage. This advantage increases if White manages to expand on the kingside, restricting Black's pieces substantially. Black's play can be rather difficult, and great precision is required to avoid being asphyxiated. A main theme in this variation is whether Black manages to trade off some minor pieces to decrease his space problem. In addition, the control of the e4-square is often an important factor to determine whether Black can equalize or not. Let's discuss specific plans:  White's plans  1. Expand on the kingside with f2-f4, g2-g4 and potentially create an attack.  2. Attack the vulnerable d6-pawn with a bishop on the h2-b8 diagonal and a knight on e4.  3. Sometimes White will also play b2-b4, but there is really not much to be gained on the queenside. In fact, opening the queenside could give Black chances for much-needed counterplay.  Black's plans  1. Control the e4-square and occupy it with a knight.  2. Break on the queenside with ...b7-b5 , and obtain counterplay against a potentially weak d5-pawn.  3. Trade off minor pieces to decrease the space problem. Sometimes this can be achieved with the sequence ...Qb6, ...Bf5 and ...Ne4 which can also create pressure against the b2-pawn.  White's kingside expansion is the most important plan in the position, and Black's plans are aimed at fighting against it. After White plays f2-f4, Black should typically reply with ...f7-f5 to claim some space before it is too late. Later he should be ready to prevent g2-g4, as White could gain a decisive spatial advantage with this expansion. Black's Plan 2 is probably the most active and interesting reaction and should be considered in a variety of positions even in the form of a pawn sacrifice. The virtue of this sacrifice is that it opens many lines, and may ruin White's kingside expansion into a weakening.  The first game in this chapter is an older example which illustrates White's Plan 1 being executed to perfection. Then, the second game is a more modern version where Black finds a better defensive plan, though still remaining passive. The third game illustrates White's Plan 2, while White's Plan 3 is not really covered simply because it is not as important or useful. Then, the last three games in the chapter illustrate Black's Plans 1 -3 in that order. } 1. -- *

Black was positionally crushed, and it is not even obvious what his mistake was.  2. I believe Black’s biggest mistake was choosing to play this type of structure under unfavourable conditions. In recent years, White has scored over 80% from the position after 10.Qd1; this should tell us something.  3. Black’s biggest problem was being unable to prevent White’s expansion with g2-g4. In an ideal case, Black would have had a knight on f6 and a bishop on c8 preventing such an advance.  4. After White’s 18th move g4-g5, I cannot find any good suggestions for Black. His position is bad, and his defensive task near impossible to conduct.  5. As the reader may have noticed, the opening of the kingside often turned out to favour White. This is a characteristic inherited from the structure c4-d5 vs. c5-d6: this tiny spatial advantage makes all the difference. } *

Black played much better than in the game Spassky – Fischer. The main difference was a more precise piece arrangement which prevented an early g2-g4 expansion.  2. Despite Black’s precise opening sequence, White always preserved a small plus, which becomes manifest around move 30 due to his unstoppable plan to play Nh2 followed by g3-g4 claiming some kingside space.  3. White’s mistake 37.gxh6 was a colossal positional concession. Instead, the calm 37.Qa1 would have provided excellent winning chances without any risks. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Yaroslav Zherebukh – Mauricio Flores Rios, Southwest Collegiate, USA 2013@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objectives:  1. This game is an example of how Black may carry out an effective ...b7-b5 sacrifice, in order to dispute White’s control of the game.  2. Something to note is how this sacrifice shifts the attention away from White’s positional plans. } 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 Ne4 3. Bf4 c5 4. f3 Qa5+ 5. c3 Nf6 6. d5 Qb6 7. Bc1 e6 8. e4 exd5 9. exd5 Bd6 10. c4 { We have reached the thematic structure via a very unusual move order. } 10... O-O { White does not seem to know what he is doing. He has not developed a single piece while Black has already castled. However, he has obtained a symmetric Benoni structure, which often gives White a stable centre and a lasting spatial advantage. I knew that if I allowed White to organize his pieces harmoniously, then I would be inferior despite my lead in development. } 11. Bd3 Qc7 12. Ne2 b5 { I thought breaking on the queenside to undermine White’s coordination was my only way to avoid being squeezed as in the previous examples. I believe I was right about this evaluation. This pawn sacrifice manages to divert attention away from White’s plans due to the multiple threats.   Instead the bishop is lost after  12...Bxh2 ?  13.f4.   Natural development will lead Black into an inferior position. For example:  12...Re8 ?!  13.Nbc3  a6   Again  13...Bxh2 ?  leads to trouble, now after  14.Kf1 !  threatening f3-f4:  14...Be5  15.Nb5 !  Qb6  16.f4  Bd4  17.Nexd4  cxd4  18.b4 !  +- Followed by c4-c5 or  Bb2  with an overwhelming centre and kingside attack.  14.Bg5  Be7  15.O-O  += White is likely to take over the game as in the previous examples, most likely through a kingside expansion. } 13. cxb5 { Accepting the challenge.   Safer was  13.Na3 !?  bxc4  14.Nxc4  Bb7  15.Nc3  Re8+  16.Kf1  with an unclear position. } 13... c4 14. Bc2 Bc5 { The logical continuation. Black has excellent compensation due to the misplacement of White’s king and the weakened d5- and b5-pawns. } 15. Nbc3 { This is a small inaccuracy, as it allows Black to arrange his pieces well with ...d7-d6 followed by ...Nbd7 and ...Re8.   Somewhat better was:  15.Bg5  Qe5  16.Qd2   or  16.Bxf6 ?!  Qxf6  17.Nbc3  Re8  18.Kf1  d6  when White’s position is rather delicate, for example  19.Qe1 ??  Qxf3+ !  20.gxf3  Bh3#  16...a6 !?   16...Qxb2 ??  loses to  17.Bxh7+  17.b6 !  With a dynamic balance where any result is possible, say after:  17...Nxd5 !?  18.Be4  Bb7  19.Nbc3  Nxc3  20.Bxb7  Nxe2  21.Qxe2  Qxg5  22.Bxa8  Bxb6  ∞ } 15... d6 { Now Black is able to arrange his pieces nicely with ...Nbd7, ...Re8 and ...Bb7 with a very comfortable position. } 16. Kf1 { The alternative  16.Bg5  is unsafe after  16...Nbd7  17.Qd2  a6 !  opening lines for a dangerous attack. For example:  18.bxa6  Bxa6  19.Be3  Qb6  20.Nd4  Rfe8  21.O-O-O  Rab8  ∓   Trading off the annoying bishop with  16.Na4  Re8  17.Nxc5  Qxc5  leads to an inferior endgame after:  18.Kf1  Nbd7  19.Qd4  Nxd5  =+ } 16... Nbd7 17. g4 { Although White’s position is not ideal, the idea g2-g4 is still valid  (even necessary)  to claim some space on the kingside, and to connect the rooks with Kg2.   It is no better to play  17.Nd4  a6  18.bxa6  Rxa6  when g2-g4 will be needed sooner or later, as White does not have much else to do. For example,  19.Bg5 ?!  Qb6  20.Ndb5  Re8  21.Qd2  Bb7  ∓ when White lacks a constructive plan and he still has not connected his rooks. } 17... Bb7 { A serious imprecision.   Accurate was:  17...Ne5 !  18.Kg2  a6  19.bxa6   Instead the optimistic  19.g5 ?  fails due to:  19...Qd7  20.h3   20.gxf6 ??  Qh3#  20...Nh5  21.Na4  f6 !  Bringing the rook into the attack.  22.Nxc5  dxc5  23.Nf4  fxg5 !  24.Nxh5  Nxf3  Black’s attack is irresistible.   Also the natural  19.Ng3 ?  runs into:  19...Nfxg4 !  20.fxg4  Bxg4  -+  19...Rxa6  Now Black has an excellent initiative for the pawn. White must be extra careful, for example:  20.Ng3 ?  Nfxg4 !  21.fxg4  Bxg4  22.Qd2  Bf3+  23.Kf1  f5 !  Black has a crushing attack. } 18. g5 Ne8 19. f4 { White gains more space on the kingside, but this move is careless as it allows Black some tactical resources associated with the weakened a8-h1 diagonal.   Correct was  19.Kg2 !  a6   19...Nb6 ?  is bad due to  20.a4 !  ± followed by a4-a5-a6  20.bxa6  Rxa6  ∞ when chances are approximately level. } 19... Nb6 { Black’s plan is to create pressure on the d5-pawn. } 20. Be4 { Logical, but inaccurate.   Better was  20.Ng3  since now  20...Qd7  is met by  21.Bf5  with an unclear game.   Instead  20.Ng3  a6 !?  allows Black to retain his initiative, say after  21.bxa6  Rxa6  22.Be4  Qd7  23.Kg2  f5 !  24.Bf3  Nc7  =+ when the d5-pawn is likely to be lost. } 20... Qd7 21. Kg2 { During the game I was happy to realize that  21.a4 ?!  with the idea of a4-a5-a6 suppressing Black’s counterplay, fails tactically to:  21...Nc7  22.a5 ?  Nbxd5 !  The weakening of the long diagonal now becomes evident.  23.Nxd5  Nxd5  24.Bxd5  Qh3+ !  The key move.  25.Ke1  Qh4+  26.Ng3   26.Kf1 ??  Qf2#  26...Rfe8+  27.Kd2   27.Kf1 ??  Qh3+  28.Bg2  Bxg2#  27...Bxd5  And Black is winning. } 21... Nc7 { ∓ It becomes clear that the ...b7-b5 sacrifice has paid off, since the d5-pawn and the a8-h1 diagonal are very weak. Most importantly, White has been unable to arrange his pieces in harmony, as he achieved in the previous examples. } 22. Ng3 { It is just too late for  22.a4 ?!  due to  22...Rae8 !  23.a5 ?  Nbxd5 !  when everything falls apart. For example:  24.Bxd5  Qg4+  25.Ng3  Nxd5 !  26.Qxg4  Nxf4+  27.Kf1  Bg2# } 22... Rfe8 { With the idea of a potential ...Rxe4 followed by ...Nbxd5 with a strong initiative.   Even stronger was  22...Rae8 !  ∓ with the additional option of  ...f7-f6  opening the f-file. } 23. Bf3 { 23.Re1 ?  does not help:  23...Nbxd5 !  -+   Or  23.Rf1  Nxb5  24.Nxb5  Qxb5  , when the threat of  ...Rxe4  remains strong. For example,  25.Qf3  Rxe4  26.Nxe4  Bxd5  followed by  ...Qc6  and  ...Re8  winning.   An alternative was:  23.Qf3  Nxb5  ∓ } 23... Nxb5 { I completely missed  23...Bb4 !  followed by  ...Bxc3  and  ...Nbxd5  , which is simply winning. } 24. Nxb5 Qxb5 25. a4 Qa5 26. Bd2 { If  26.Nf5 !?  then Black breaks through White’s position with:  26...c3 !  ∓ } 26... Qa6 27. Bc3 { A calculation error in time trouble.   Defending the d5-pawn with  27.Bc1 ?!  does not help because of  27...c3 !  28.bxc3  Qc4  followed by  ...Bxd5  with a strong attack.   Accurate was  27.b4 !  cxb3  28.Qxb3  Qc4  29.Qxc4  Nxc4  =+ when Black is better, though White has some chances to hold the game. } 27... Re3 28. Re1 Nxd5 { -+   The key to  28...Nxd5  is that after  29.Bxd5  Rd3  Black regains the piece with a crushing attack. Black is winning, but the game was eventually drawn as White found good resources in mutual time pressure.  Final remarks  1. White’s opening deserves careful examination. If Black had not chosen 8...b5, he would have been left without active plans, and his development lead would have been worthless.  2. Black’s ...b7-b5 pawn sacrifice was effective because the d5-pawn immediately became a target and because White’s king became vulnerable. Without these factors this sacrifice could have been a failure.  3. It is worth noticing how White never really managed to organize his forces towards anything other than protecting his weaknesses. And everything Black achieved was at the sole cost of a pawn! This means the ...b7-b5 sacrifice is often well justified as long as Black can seize immediate counterplay. } *
