{ @@HeaderStart@@Open KID@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure most typically comes from the King's Indian Defence when Black captures with ...e5xd4, though the same structure can be obtained in some lines of the Bogo-Indian, or the Philidor Defence as soon as White manages to play c2-c4 to increase his spatial advantage. In most of these positions, Black will include the moves ...g7-g6 to fianchetto the bishop, and ...c7-c6 to prevent White from placing a knight on d5.  White often enjoys a small advantage in this structure because of his space and because the d6-pawn can be a serious target either in the middlegame or in an eventual endgame. The opening and post-opening phase are crucial, as these moves often determine whether Black will obtain counterplay or not. If White manages to arrange his pieces ideally without first falling into some tactical problems, then he is likely to have a lasting advantage, forcing Black into a dull defensive task. So why do Black players accept this structure? There are two reasons:  1. If one wishes to play the King's Indian Defence, it is unavoidable to play this structure once in a while.  2. These positions can lead to sharp tactical complications which give Black realistic chances to play for the full point. High tactical precision is often required from both sides.  White's plans  1. Pressure along the d-file, attacking the vulnerable d6-pawn.  2. Expand on the kingside with f2-f4, and possibly g2-g4.  3. When the right time comes, break on the kingside with either e4-e5 or f4-f5.  4. Avoid an excessive trade of pieces in order to make use of the spatial advantage.  5. If this is possible, expand on the queenside as well with a2-a3 and b2-b4.  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to decrease the space problem. Trading a couple of minor pieces is often good enough.  2. Place knights on e5 and c5 and then play ...Qb6-b4 attacking the c4-pawn. If White replies b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3 followed by ...Ra3 is a good plan. The drawback of this plan is that Black's queen can be targeted.  3. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5 to unleash his pieces.  4. Dispute White's control of the centre with the break ...f7-f5, trading the f-pawn for White's e4-pawn.  5. Attack White's c4-pawn with ...a7-a6, ...c7-c6 and ...b7-b5, to reduce White's control of the centre.  6. Create a kingside attack; place a knight on f4, and possibly play ...g6-g5, to control the f4-square, and to prevent White from expanding with f3-f4.  For White, the most important task is to keep his pieces well coordinated while refraining from trading pieces if possible. If this is achieved, then the d6-pawn will remain vulnerable while the kingside expansion will be easily achievable. For Black, the most important task is to remain active and to be able to continuously create threats, or trade pieces, before White gains a stable advantage. Black's Plan 3, the ...d6-d5 break, is ideal but very hard to accomplish in practice. Black's remaining plans are all equally important and choosing among them requires good calculating ability more than anything else.  As a King's Indian player I was often reluctant to play the plan with ...g6-g5  (Plan 6)  because it seems to be a positional aberration. But it turns out that this plan can actually be very effective if applied correctly, and we will see some examples in this chapter.  The first game in this chapter is an example of White's ideal piece arrangement and the subsequent kingside expansion. The second example illustrates how Black's Plan 2 can backfire and his queen can become trapped. The third example briefly discusses Black's ...f7-f5 break, and then we move on to Black's ...g6-g5 plans with three examples.  It might seem paradoxical that I say this structure is superior for White and then I include only two examples in which White wins. The reason for this decision was that the first example in this chapter is good enough to describe most of White's victories. In fact, White wins the first game in such a convincing manner that I spend the rest of the chapter providing ideas for Black players to fight against White's seemingly superior strategy. } 1. -- *

White’s biggest mistake was playing 16.Bb3, as this bishop was needed in the defence of the kingside.  2. Black’s post-opening sequence  (moves 11-18)  deserve to be praised. Note how Black keeps the threats coming, managing to trade one minor piece, prevent f2-f4 with 16...Be5, and then even create a kingside attack with 18...Qh4.   3. From a static perspective  (ignoring tactics or the initiative)  Black’s ...g6-g5-g4 break does not look good. By trading his g-pawn for White’s h-pawn Black weakens his structure significantly. The point here is that Black cannot afford to obtain a passive position and this plan is a great method for obtaining activity. If Black executes the ...g6-g5-g4 break well, then White will not have the time to take advantage of Black’s structural weaknesses. } *

It can serve two purposes: 1. Preventing White from achieving the favourable f2-f4. 2. Preparing the ...g5-g4 break to gain counterplay. Obviously this is Blacks plan here, taking advantage of Whites awkwardly-placed queen. } *

{ The following game is an interesting example from my own experience. I had always had trouble with this structure and I spent the first few hours of the game just hoping to lose in an honourable way, yet somehow things worked out for me in the end.

The problem for Black is that White can just play  15.Qd2  Kh7  16.Rad1 !?  ± to continue with a2-a3, b2-b4 and only then clarify the centre.

Black was unable to maintain the central tension and was eventually forced to play ...exd4 obtaining an open King’s Indian. It would have been better to accept this pawn structure with 10...exd4 and begin searching for counterplay before White could consolidate his position.  2. White’s biggest mistake was 20.a3, allowing the a-file to be opened. From this point on, Black’s play was a good model of how Black may obtain counterplay.  3. The advance ...g6-g5  (as I chose on move 30)  is not quite as uncommon as one might expect for such a wild-looking move. We have already seen some examples earlier in the chapter. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Complex@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure is most typically obtained from the King's Indian and the Old Indian Defences, though it can also appear in the Ruy Lopez. I decided to name this structure King's Indian Complex to be consistent with the term introduced by Soltis in the 1970's. This structure is called a 'complex' because it is a highly flexible structure open to many possibilities. In fact, this structure could transpose to seven  (!)  structures we have previously discussed in this book, and here we still need to discuss some independent structural developments.  Here follows the outline of possible structure transformations:  1. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and White replies exd5, we obtain a Najdorf Type I  (Chapter 8)  .  2. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and White recaptures with a piece, we obtain a NajdorfType II  (Chapter 9)  .  3. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and White replies cxd5, to obtain a King's Indian Type I  (Chapter 14)  .  4. White plays d4-d5 and Black replies ...c6-c5, then we obtain a King's Indian Type II  (Chapter 15)  .  5. White plays d4-d5 while Black's pawn was still on c7, then we obtain a King's Indian Type III  (Chapter 16)  .  6. Black takes ...exd4, then we obtain an Open King's Indian  (Chapter 17)  .  And in this chapter we will consider two additional possibilities:  7. White takes with dxe5 and Black replies ...dxe5. This chapter will mostly focus on ideas about this structure.  8. White breaks with c4-c5, blowing up the centre. This break will probably give White a favourable version of a 4-2 vs. 3-3 structure, which was mentioned in Chapter 3.  Despite the long list of structures and possibilities mentioned above, I believe the most common outcomes from a King's Indian complex are 4, 5 and 7, and since Cases 4 and 5 have been previously studied, four of the five games in this chapter will be devoted to studying the structure resulting from Case 7. The last game in the chapter will be an example of White's c4-c5 break. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@White takes dxe5 and Black replies ...dxe5@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure occurs when pawns are traded on e5 in a King's Indian complex; it is essentially the only structure with an independent value, i.e. a structure not discussed in previous chapters. Despite the apparent symmetry of the position there is a visible imbalance due to the placement of the c-pawns. White's c4-pawn is more advanced giving some spatial advantage, especially if the pawn is further advanced with c4-c5. In contrast, Black's c6-pawn covers the important d5-square, preventing White's knight from going there. The strategic battle is based on this fact. Black will direct his efforts toward controlling the d4-square, while White will attempt to gain space, obtain other advantages and prevent Black from making use of d4. The specific plans are:  White's plans  1. Modify the structure with the c4-c5 advance. Later, place a piece on the new outpost on d6.  2. Defend the d4-square, and prevent Black from occupying it.  3. Expand on the queenside with a2-a3 and b2-b4. Control the d-file and possibly invade on the seventh rank.  Black's plans  1. Place a piece on the d4-square, preferably a knight.  2. Control the dark squares in general; trade dark-squared bishops. Also, play ...a7-a5 and place a knight on c5.  3. Create kingside play with ...f7-f5, especially as a distraction to White's queenside plans. White's Plan 1 is by far the most important and the beginning moves in this structure will rotate around it, as White wants to achieve it while Black desires to prevent it. If this advance can be permanently banned, then Black will generally be doing well. In contrast, if White manages to play c4-c5 then Black will need to react quickly, and Plan 3  (...f7-f5 with kingside play)  is most likely to be the right approach.  The first two examples in this chapter illustrate Black's dark-squared strategy - the control of the d4-square and the prevention of White's c4-c5 advance. Later, the third game showcases an easy victory for White after the c4-c5 advance is achieved. The fourth game in the chapter illustrates how Black responds to White's c4-c5 advance by creating kingside play with ...f7-f5.  Although I usually prefer recent top games over older games, I could not resist the temptation to begin this chapter with one of Kasparov's classic games, against Danailov from 1980. This game is a superb example of Black's dream strategy in this position. White certainly made some serious mistakes, but these mistakes are very illustrative and deserve study. } 1. -- *

Nd3 { Threatening ...Nb4. } 25. a3 Nc5 { And now the b3-square is weak. } 26. h4 h5 27. Re3 g5 { The threat of ...g5-g4 makes White’s position collapse. } 28. hxg5 fxg5 29.

Kb1 Kf6 { White resigns, in view of  31.Kc2  g4  32.Nh2  Nd4+  or  31.Nh2  Rd1+  32.Kc2  Rg1.  The final position is rather picturesque; it gives a crystal-clear illustration of Black’s dream plans in the position arising after White captures with dxe5.  Final remarks  1. Many King’s Indian players are afraid of this Exchange Variation because they worry that White can secure a draw with it. I hope this example gives some ideas about how to play for an advantage once White commits any inaccuracies.  2. It is extremely important to remember White’s positional mistake with 14.Bxf6. This trade gives up the control of the dark squares, which Black then uses in an ideal fashion.  3. Black took advantage of his dark-square dominance with great elegance and precision. Probably the most important part in imposing the advantage was the manoeuvre ...Bd8, ...a5-a4 and ...Ba5 turning an otherwise useless bishop into a powerful attacking piece. } *

He certainly could have obtained an equal position given more precise play, though it would have been difficult to play for an advantage.  2. The biggest problem for White was 12.a3 hoping for the impossible b2-b4. White should calculate this in advance, and if b2-b4 cannot be achieved, then a2-a3 should not be played.  3. Black’s position became clearly more comfortable after ...a5-a4, as this move prevented White’s queenside play and left the c4-pawn ‘isolated’ from the b-pawn and therefore vulnerable.  4. Black’s decision to open up the game with 24...f5 proved very effective and it was a logical approach as White had given up the pair of bishops. This move allowed the game to be won very easily and convincingly. } *

The advance c4-c5 can be extremely strong and Black must prepare something very concrete against it. In this game, probably the only option was 21...c5 to prevent c4-c5 altogether. Other options to meet c4-c5 are to create a direct kingside attack, or to challenge White’s c5-pawn with ...b7-b6. In this game the ...b7-b6 idea did not work well because Black’s a-pawn was already on a6. So if White played c5xb6 then Black would have to recapture with a piece, leaving the c6-pawn isolated, as we saw in the note to 24...b5.   2. Once White achieved the c4-c5 advance a crucial element in the victory was bringing in pieces with Kh2-h4-Bh3 and later simply trading off those pieces Black was using to keep his queenside protected. The weakness of the b7-pawn was enough to decide the game convincingly. } *

Once White has achieved the c4-c5 advance, the kingside reaction ...f7-f5 is necessary. The resulting position is often complicated and risky for both sides, but Black does not have much of a choice if he wants to avoid a painful defeat, as we saw in the previous example.  2.

The centre may transform into a variety of different positions, and Black’s trade will only be beneficial in some of these. For example, based on the first game from this chapter we know White will not be interested in playing dxe5 after exchanging bishops, as the d4-square would become weak.

I must warn the reader that this idea is quite typical and Black should always carefully consider the consequences of this break.

Black’s decision to trade dark-squared bishops was ill-conceived because the situation in the centre was not yet well determined.  2. White’s c4-c5 break was an excellent decision, undermining Black’s centre and opening lines of attack for the bishop on g2. If instead White had played d4-d5, then Black could have closed the centre with ...c6-c5 in which case the trading of dark-squared bishops would have been justified.  3. The strength of the c4-c5 break is enhanced if Black has already played ...b7-b5 as the c6-pawn becomes vulnerable. Nevertheless, the c4-c5 break can work well even if Black has not played ...b7-b5. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@French Type I@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure often arises from the French and Caro-Kann defences, after Black challenges White's pawn chain with the typical ...f7-f6 break. The most important theme in this position is the control of the e5-square. If White is able to gain firm control of this square his position will generally be superior. For this reason Black must find counterplay rather quickly in order to avoid being dominated. Black's counterplay will usually be based on attacking White's d4-pawn. For this reason Black will typically play ...c5xd4 rather than ...c5-c4, which would release the tension on the d4-pawn, and thus allow White to have a solid centre. Specific plans are as follows.  White's plans  1. Control the e5-square and use it as an outpost for a knight, although a rook or bishop would also be powerful on this square.  2. Pressure the backward e6-pawn by doubling rooks on the e-file.  3. If White has already gained control of e5, then expand on the kingside, possibly with f2-f4 or h2-h4-h5 in order to create an attack.  Black's plans  All Black's plans are essentially based on preventing White from controlling the e5-square; they are:  1. Pressure the d4-pawn, play ...c7-c5xd4, ...Nc6 and sometimes ...Qb6.  2. Bring the light-squared bishop into the game with ...Bd7-e8-h5  (or g6)  . Since White typically has a knight on f3, a bishop on h5 would produce an unpleasant pin  (against White's queen on d1)  while also undermining the d4-pawn.  3. Double rooks on the f-file and possibly follow up with the exchange sacrifice ...Rxf3 capturing White's knight, undermining White's centre and kingside.  4. Achieve the central break ...e6-e5, to obtain an isolated and passed d-pawn.  As the reader may notice, this position is fairly one-dimensional. Everything revolves around the e5-square, and I believe the key for both sides is to know when it is a good idea to go into this position, and when it is not. The first game in this chapter will illustrate White's domination once he achieves control of the e5-square. Essentially all of his plans will be combined to yield a very convincing victory. The second example illustrates Black's exchange sacrifice with ...Rxf3 and the third example showcases Black's Plan 4 and the resulting position in which the isolated d-pawn is both a potential weakness and a potential threat because it is also a passed pawn.  This chapter is relatively short because the ideas presented in this structure are rather simple. In addition, the reason I only include one victory for White is because most of White's victories follow exactly the same path. I found many good examples, but they all communicate the same ideas over and over. What the reader must understand is: once White controls the e5-square he will have an excellent position and most of the plans listed above will be possible and strong. } 1. -- *

White’s break h4-h5 was essential in the victory as it forced the creation of a new weakness – the g6-pawn.  4. In retrospect, we realize that having a pawn on g6 should have been a red flag for Black, indicating his position would be bad after 11...f6. Had the pawn been on g7 it would have been harder for White to break on the kingside  (e.g. h4-h5 would not hit anything yet)  . } *

Qxe5 { Despite material equality, White’s position is strategically lost since he has weaknesses all over the board, such as the pawns on b2, f3, f2, as well as his vulnerable king. } 21.

White would have been better off playing 14.Ne2 instead.  2. Black’s exchange sacrifice was fully justified.

{ @@HeaderStart@@French Type II@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure primarily arises from the French Defence, especially from versions of the line   1.e4  e6  2.d4  d5  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5  Nfd7  5.f4  c5  6.Nf3  Nc6  7.Be3  cxd4  8.Nxd4.  Another common way to obtain this structure is from a typical Sicilian Scheveningen structure  (mentioned in Chapter 22)  , in which Black manages to get in the ...d6-d5 break and White replies with e4-e5. This position is a mirror image of the King's Indian Type III-B studied in Chapter 16, but the character of the game is not quite the same because of the position of the kings  (which typically castle short)  . In this structure White has chances for a mating attack, which he did not have in the structure mentioned before. Despite this difference, other ideas remain the same. For example, White desires to have firm control of d4 and to place a knight on this square  (like the e4-square from Chapter 16)  . Also, the chain reaction f4-f5  (by analogy with c4-c5 in the structure in Chapter 16)  is still strong. The plans for this structure are:  White's plans  1. Control the d4-square, place a knight on d4 and support it with c2-c3, a bishop on e3 and possibly a rook on d1.  2. Attack the base of Black's chain with f4-f5xe6 to later target the e6-pawn.  3. Obtain a kingside attack with f4-f5-f6 together with bringing pieces to the kingside such as Qh5, Rf3-h3, Bd3.  4. Castle long and then pursue a kingside pawn storm with h2-h4-h5, g2-g4-g5, etc.  Black's plans  1. Undermine White's pawn chain with the central break ...f7-f6. This is generally an effective way to draw attention away from White's kingside attack.  2. Undermine White's e5-pawn with ...g7-g5, even as a pawn sacrifice.  3. Simplify the position to decrease the influence of White's spatial advantage and the power of White's attack.  4. Trade the bad bishop  (the light-squared bishop)  or find a way to place it outside the pawn chain, preferably on the b1-h7 diagonal.  5. Pursue a queenside minority attack with ...b7-b5-b4. This plan can be a positional idea to create weaknesses when White castles short, or can be used as an attacking plan if White has castled long.  The first game in this chapter is an example of White's kingside attack, while the second illustrates how Black can neutralize this action with his Plan 1  (the ...f7-f6 break)  . The third example illustrates how bad it can be to have a bad bishop  (with reversed colours)  , while the fourth example showcases Black's strong light-squared bishop on g6, combined with Plan 4. The fifth game in this chapter is an example of opposite-flank attacks once White castles long. This chapter finishes with two short examples. The first of these illustrates Black's Plans 2 and 3 combined, while the last example shows how Black may trade light-squared bishops.  As the reader may notice, whether White castles short or long has an important effect on the nature of the game. Both options are very common, but six out of my seven examples have White castling short for pedagogical reasons. The positions resulting from long castling tend to be very sharp, and tactical complications often dominate over strategic ideas. It is good to know these games with long castling, but one is unlikely to learn strategy from them. For this reason I thought one example should satisfy the curiosity of the readers while giving me the opportunity to show at least some tactical ideas in this position. } 1. -- *

Black experiences some difficulties after  14.Qf2 !  planning to proceed with  Ne2  and  Ned4  and then a kingside attack, but having first prevented the manoeuvre  ...Nb6-c4.  Now a possible reaction is:  14...f6 !?   the tempting  14...Nxb4 ?  15.axb4  Qxc3  fails due to  16.f5 !  ± when White obtains a strong attack.   while  14...O-O  15.Ne2  += is similar to the game  15.Nd4  Nxd4  16.Bxd4  O-O  17.Qh4   17.Qe3 !?  +=  17...g6  18.Qh3 !  f5  19.g4 !?  += } 14...

Qxe3 { This is a good moment to assess the position. White is better for the following reasons:  1. He has undisputed control of the d4-square.  2. Black’s bad bishop is completely locked in by his pawns.  3. White may create a kingside attack, while Black cannot advance on the queenside.  4. The pressure on e6 prevents Black from one of his typical plans – the break ...f7-f6. } 17... g6 18. c3 { Launching an attack with  18.g4  is a little premature due to  18...h5 !  19.h3  Nxd4  20.Nxd4  hxg4  21.hxg4  Rh4  with an unclear position. } 18... O-O { Black is basically inviting White to begin his kingside attack, as he has probably underestimated how strong it will actually be.   It was probably better to play  18...h5 !?  delaying the kingside attack, but now White can direct his attention to the queenside with  19.a4  += or play  19.g3 !?  to slowly build a kingside attack after h2-h3, g3-g4, etc. } 19. g4 { Everything is ready to continue with f4-f5. } 19... Nxd4 20. Nxd4 { This move is conceptually correct, as the knight and rook support the break f4-f5. Unfortunately, it misses a stronger continuation, and allows a strong reply, as we shall see.   Stronger was  20.cxd4 !  when Black has nothing better than  20...f5  to prevent f4-f5   if  20...Rfc8  21.f5  Qc3  22.h4 !

Qb6 { The decisive mistake.   20...Kh8  would have allowed Black to meet  21.f5  with the strong  21...gxf5  22.gxf5  Bg5 !  with a rather unclear position.   But instead, after  20...Kh8  White has the simple  21.Rac1  protecting the c3-pawn and preparing an attack with h2-h4-h5. Black does not have much to do, for example  21...Rac8  22.h4  Rfe8   22...Bxh4 ?  23.g5  +-  23.h5  Bf8  24.Kg2  Bg7  25.Rh1  ± with a crushing attack.

Although White’s move 13.b4 seems like a positional mistake  (it creates a weak c4-square, and turns c2 into a backward pawn)  this move is thematic in this position and it works well to cover the c5-square and fix Black’s queenside structure. This prevents Black from playing ...b5-b4 and ...a6-a5, thus keeping Black’s bishop on b7 locked out of the game.  2. Black’s biggest mistake was 16...Nxe3 which allowed White some extra support for his e5-pawn, to later push f4-f5 optimally.  3. The reader should remember Black’s reaction ...exf5 followed by ...f6 ! to stop White’s attack in the note 16...O-O.   4. Once White achieves the f4-f5 break under optimal conditions, there is essentially nothing Black can do to prevent a deadly mating attack. A reason for White’s success in this game was his control of the d4-square and Black’s inability to use his bishop on b7. In practical terms, White had an extra piece for the attack, and thus it comes as no surprise that his attack was a success. } *

This game was a fine illustration of how a strong knight can dominate a bad bishop. In fact, White’s bishop did not do anything useful throughout the entire game.  2. From this example, the reader should learn to treat the bad bishop as a serious problem and find the first opportunity to trade it or make use of it. In this game, White was probably too careless to realize that 22.Ba3 could secure equality, while 22.Bd2 would lock the bishop inside the pawn chain permanently.  3. From Black’s play, the pawn sacrifice 36...h4 followed by 40...g5 was simply superb, as White cannot survive once the position becomes open. } *

And the disadvantage to Black of having a bishop on the h7-b1 diagonal becomes evident. Typically c3-c4 allows  ...dxc4  giving a powerful diagonal to the bishop on  b7.  But here only White’s pieces will benefit from  ...dxc4  as lines open for the rooks and  e4  is cleared for the knight.  27...dxc4  28.Rxc4  Black must be precise to avoid problems, for example:  28...Qd7 ?   Correct is  28...Qb7  29.h6  Ne7  30.Qg5  Bg6  with a complicated game where White has a plus.  The text move runs into:  29.h6 !  Ne7  30.Rd4  Nd5  31.Qg5  Bg6  32.hxg7  Kxg7  33.Nh5+  And White is winning. } 27... bxc3 28. bxc3 Rab8 { The game continued: } 29. h6 { Increasing White’s problems.   Safer was  29.Qg4  Bd3  30.h6  g6  31.a4  Rb2  32.Qf4  Rcb8  ∓ though Black is in control. } 29... gxh6 30. gxh6 Kh8 31. Re2 Rg8 { And now it is Black who will attack on the kingside. White is lost already as his pieces are poorly coordinated, while his pawns are spread as weaknesses across the board. } 32. Kh2 Qg5 33. Be3 Qxf4 34. Bxf4 Rg4 { Now White will fall into an unlikely mating net. } 35. Rf2 Rbg8 36. Kh3 { The option  36.Kg2  Be4+  37.Kh3  Ne7  is similar to the game. } 36... Ne7 { This is the key; the knight comes to f5 clearing the g-file and supporting ...Rh4. } 37. Rf3 { 37.Rg1  doesn’t help after  37...Nf5  38.Rf3  Rh4+  39.Kg2  Rxf4 !  40.Rxf4  Rxg3+  41.Kf2  Rxc3. } 37... Be4 38. h7 Kxh7 { White resigns, as he is either losing material or getting mated.   39.Rf2   or  39.Nxe4  dxe4  40.Rf2  Nf5  followed by  Rh4#  39...Nf5 !  40.Nxf5  Bxf5  and mate is unstoppable, for example:  41.Bd2   41.Kh2  Rh4#  41...Rg3+  42.Kh2  Rh3#  Final remarks  1. The fact that Black’s bishop was on the h7-b1 diagonal played a key role throughout the game. The main thing to notice is how White could not carry out his standard f4-f5 break because this bishop was ideally placed to prevent it. Instead he had to settle for the far less effective h2-h4-h5 plan which ultimately backfired.  2. Black’s queenside counterplay with ...b5-b4 was also a significant obstacle to White’s attack, forcing him to hurry up in his kingside actions. Black probably should have kept an eye on the possible 27.c4 ! and in retrospect it could have been better to play 22...b4 opening the queenside at once.  3. If we observe the later stages of the game, we see how Black’s supposedly bad bishop actually combines attack and defence in an excellent fashion. In contrast, White’s bad bishop on f2 really is a bad piece and contributes nothing to the battle. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Evgeniy Najer – Mari Jurcik, Czech Republic 2014@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game is an example of the opposite-flank storms arising after White castles long. } 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O { I did not really want to cover an opposite-sides castling game, as they are often dominated by tactical shots rather than strategy. However, I found this game so interesting and instructive that I could not resist the temptation to include it. The strategic elements previously discussed are still valid: Black has a bad bishop on c8, while White has a strong knight on d4. The ideas of f4-f5 for White, and ...f7-f6 for Black, are still valid. In addition, each player has the possibility of conducting a pawn storm against the opponent’s king. } 10... a6 11. Nb3 { So far both players have followed theory, and now Black deviates with: } 11... Be7 { This is not so common. More popular alternatives are  11...Bb4   or  11...b6 !? } 12. g4 { Now the pawn storm begins and both players prepare an attack. } 12... b5 { The usual idea  12...f6 ?!  does not work as well here after:  13.exf6   or  13.Nxd5 !?  13...Nxf6  14.h3  += White is positionally better due to his harmonious piece placement and the weakened e6-pawn. } 13. h4 Na5 { 13...b4 !?  deserves attention, as White needs to make a crucial decision between placing his knight on  a4  or  e2.  If the knight is placed on  a4  it may become subject to attack, say after  ...Bb7-c6.  If the knight goes to  e2  , then the advance  ...a6-a5-a4  comes more quickly.  14.Ne2   14.Na4 !?  14...a5  15.Nbd4  Nxd4  16.Nxd4  Qc7  With balanced chances. } 14. Bd4 Nc4 15. Qg2 Qc7 16. Bd3 { We have reached the critical position in this game. White’s last move prepares a very strong attack after h4-h5 and g4-g5-g6, or maybe a sacrifice on h7, or playing Rdg1. Extreme care is needed from both players. } 16... Rb8 { This natural-looking move is actually a near-decisive mistake for Black. I presume he was not familiar with the attacking scheme White intended to use.   A safer alternative was  16...Nc5 !  intending to trade off some pieces to reduce White’s attacking chances:  17.Nxc5  Bxc5  18.Qf2  Bxd4  19.Qxd4  With an approximately balanced game.   The alternative  16...b4 !?  is ambitious but risky. White faces the dilemma of where to place his knight.  17.Ne2 ?  is too slow after:   But I believe that after the strong  17.Na4 !  the complications favour White, since there is no time to go after the knight on  a4.  For example,  17...Bb7  18.g5  Bc6  19.h5  Bxa4  20.Bxh7+ !  with a winning attack; this is very similar to the game.  17...a5  18.Kb1  a4  19.Nbc1  Ba6  Black’s attack arrives first, for example  20.g5  Rfc8  21.h5  Nxb2 !  with a crushing attack. } 17. g5 { White’s attack begins to take shape; at this point I do not really see any good defence against the threat of h4-h5 followed by Bxh7+ as happened in the game. } 17... b4 { It was too late for Black to trade pieces with  17...Nc5  due to  18.Bxh7+ !  Kxh7  19.h5  with a crushing attack, for example:  19...Kg8  20.g6  Nxb3+  21.axb3  Bc5  22.h6 !   17...Bb4  is futile:  18.h5  Bxc3  19.bxc3 !  Ndb6  20.Rdg1  Followed by  Bxh7+  or g5-g6 winning. } 18. Na4 { This is the final crossroads in the game; the complications are quite instructive. } 18... Qc6 { More stubborn was the computer move  18...Bb7 !  and now  19.h5  threatening  Bxh7+  is met by:  19...Ne3 !   but not  19...Rfc8 ?  20.Bxh7+ !  which wins similarly to the game  20.Bxe3  d4  21.Be4  Bxe4  22.Qxe4  dxe3  Black has managed to prevent the threat of  Bxh7+  , but now  23.g6 !  ± gives White a strong attack.   Other alternatives do not help, for example:  18...Ndb6  19.Nxb6  Nxb6  20.h5  Bd8  21.Rdg1  followed by the crushing  Bxh7+.   Or  18...Rd8  19.h5  Nf8  protecting the h7-pawn, but now  20.g6 !   20.Bxh7+ !?  is possible too  is winning after  20...fxg6  21.hxg6  h6  22.Rxh6 !  gxh6  23.g7. } 19. h5 { Black’s position is completely desperate due to the unavoidable threat of Bxh7+. } 19... Qxa4 { 19...g6  is no help:  20.Qh3  followed by  hxg6  checkmating. } 20. Bxh7+ { +- This is a decisive tactical shot that should be remembered. White is willing to be two pieces down, because he knows that the opening of the g- and h-files is decisive. } 20... Kh8 { 20...Kxh7  also fails:  21.g6+  Kg8   or  21...Kh6  22.gxf7  22.h6  And there is no good reply against the threat of  hxg7  , for example:  22...fxg6  23.Qxg6  Rf7  24.hxg7  Rxg7  25.Qxe6+  Rf7  26.Rdg1+  Kf8  27.Rh8# } 21. g6 { This is the key, posing the unstoppable threat of h5-h6, which opens the g- and h-files decisively.   But not  21.h6 ??  g6  -+ blocking the attack. } 21... Qxa2 { Note that White’s king is completely safe.   Or  21...fxg6  22.Qxg6  followed by h5-h6 and wins. } 22. h6 { Mate is coming; the game finished: } 22... Bc5 23. Qg5 Bxd4 24. hxg7+ { Black resigned, rather than play out:  24...Kxg7  25.Qh6+  Kh8  26.g7#  Final remarks  1. Once White castles long, the game becomes very complex and requires precise calculation. Black’s biggest mistake was not trading pieces with 16...Nc5, though much calculation was needed to realize this.  2. White’s attacking scheme – Bxh7 followed by g5-g6 and h5-h6 – has an effectiveness of pretty much 100%. Black should avoid it at all costs by running faster on the queenside or trading pieces with ...Nc5 before it is too late. } *
