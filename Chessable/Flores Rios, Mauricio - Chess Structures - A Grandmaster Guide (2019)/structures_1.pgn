{ @@HeaderStart@@Foreword@@HeaderEnd@@  I first met Mauricio ten years ago, as we both competed in Pan-American youth competitions. Later we both received a chess scholarship to attend the University of Texas at Brownsville. We were teammates for four years and spent countless hours studying chess together, though our training preferences were very different. Mauricio read books, analyzed his games and prepared openings. I did these things too, but in reality, the vast majority of my time was spent looking over current chess games and playing. I was surprised when Mauricio told me he had written a book partially inspired by my training methods, and I was certainly interested to see what was in it.  The truth about my training method is that looking over a game for just a couple of minutes can actually be a wonderful investment, if done correctly. The key is searching for repeating patterns; this takes some practice but is feasible. In my career, I have seen close to 100,000 chess games, including most of the grandmaster-level games played over the past decade. The cumulative experience from spending a minute or two on each of these games has allowed me to gain an excellent positional understanding. Staring at a position for a few seconds is often enough for me to see who is better, which plans will work, which pieces should be traded, etc.  Acquiring such a level of experience and positional knowledge requires many years. Going through thousands and thousands of games takes a very long time, even if you only spend a couple of minutes on each. Most importantly, being able to actually see the patterns does not come easily to everyone. Addressing these two difficulties is exactly the purpose of this book.  Chess Structures - A Grandmaster Guide is an excellent selection of model games. By studying the 140 games and fragments in this book, the reader will learn many of the most important plans, patterns and ideas in chess. The organization of this book is particularly helpful in this regard. The pawn structure is the most important factor to determine the nature of a game; therefore, studying model games classified by structure allows the reader to acquire reliable strategic knowledge much more easily. Mauricio's detailed explanations allow the reader to identify the key elements in each example. Moreover, each game constitutes a building block toward the understanding of the structure as a whole.  I am certain the readers of this book will find it both useful and entertaining. They will complete the opening phase understanding the strategic landscape of the position. Most importantly, studying this book will help them to better understand the opening itself, and even to choose variations depending on what middlegame position they wish to play. I give this book my highest recommendation, and I feel sure readers will profit from it.  GM Axel Bachmann  Ciudad del Este, Paraguay  December 2014 } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Preface@@HeaderEnd@@  The idea for this book was in the back of my mind for several years before coming to fruition. The book was born out of my desire to guide players who, like me, struggle to apply their strategic knowledge to a practical game. My aim is to provide something new to chess literature; to write the book I should have studied myself earlier in my career. This is not the typical strategy book, but before I tell you what this book is, let me tell you how I realized this book is necessary, especially for self-learners.  My progress in chess was very fast, but very difficult, even frustrating. Due to geographical and financial constraints I drew most of my knowledge from books, rather than learning from an experienced master. I studied many strategy books and I remember embracing every word in them as a piece of gold written in ink. However, as I scaled the rating ladder I was dazzled by my inability to correctly evaluate positions despite my supposedly vast strategic knowledge. I was well versed in modem strategy but sometimes the concepts in my books were contradictory, or difficult to apply in practice. I often lost games without ever understanding the reason; my books had no answers!  By the time I had become a FIDE Master, I had concluded that the strategic rules in my books only worked sometimes, and this was not good enough. I was afraid to use potentially incorrect rules and I changed my style to avoid dealing with them. I became a strong tactician and avoided strategy at all costs. Unfortunately, I could not always obtain sharp positions and in quiet games my lack of understanding often led me to lose miserably. In fact, I became a grandmaster at eighteen knowing less than half of this book's contents.  There already exist dozens of books providing an excellent introduction to chess strategy, and I recommend you read one. These books are a starting point, but they are insufficient. They teach strategic elements without shedding much light on which factors will play a bigger role in a specific position. It is like giving you several tools without telling you which one to use. A different class of strategy book provides many concrete examples and shows how the strategic tools are selected and used. Such books are often entertaining and even inspiring, but they lack specificity. At times reading these books can leave you more confused than before, as you have learned rules but do not exactly know when to apply them. My experience as a coach has only confirmed this phenomenon.  Chess Structures - A Grandmaster Guide emphasizes clarity, precision and completeness over generality. I do not intend to teach rules applicable to every position. Such rules typically do not exist. Moreover, even if such rules existed, the chance that such a complex message will be misunderstood is far too high. Let's not risk it! My aim is to provide an easy-to-understand strategic guide to the most frequently-occurring classes of positions in chess. I hope readers will find this helpful, as it greatly reduces ambiguity; it is clear when rules will be valid and when they will not. In this sense, this book is a collection of analyzed model games, logically organized into families of similar positions with common strategic ideas. As Capablanca said in his book Chess Fundamentals, every player should have a collection of games and ideas within his chess knowledge. This book intends to provide developing players with a fine selection of such games and ideas. These games are presented within the context of well-defined classes, to enhance the learning process and prevent confusion.  Naturally, the best  (and least ambiguous)  way to classify chess positions is based on their pawn structure. I divide this book into twenty-four chapters, which discuss the most interesting and common structures in modern practice. These positions encompass a wide variety of openings and middlegames, which are present in the vast majority of all chess games. I hope my readers will find this book to be a practical and, most importantly, an accessible guide to learning how these specific positions should be conducted.

{ @@HeaderStart@@What you will find in this book@@HeaderEnd@@  This book is divided into twenty-two chapters describing some of the most important and common structures in chess. Two final chapters contain a compilation of exercises and detailed solutions.  Deciding which structures deserved a chapter, and which did not proved challenging, but I am satisfied with the final selection. Chapters are ordered so that similar structures are close to one another. In fact, these structures are implicitly divided into five classes or families, each of which is more closely associated with one particular type of opening. Learning all structures within a family is very useful, as players must frequently decide between two options that yield different, yet related, structures. It is helpful to know which structure will prove more favourable. These five families are as follows:  Family One: d4 and ...d5  This family consists of the structures that will typically arise when the moves d2-d4 and ...d7-d5 occur early in the game. Typical openings would be the Queen's Gambit Orthodox Defence, the Slav or the Queen's Indian Defence, but there are many others, such as the Scandinavian, the Caro-Kann or the Alapin Variation against the Sicilian Defence. This family encompasses Chapters 1 through 7. In addition, I discuss the Panov structure in the Caro-Kann and the 3-3 vs. 4-2 pawn structure, which are related to this family, in Chapter 22.  Family Two: Open Sicilian  This family includes those structures that typically occur in the Open Sicilian. It focuses on two types of positions: those that occur when Black plays ...e7-e5 instead of ...e7-e6; and then Hedgehog and Maroczy positions. This family spans Chapters 8 through 11. The Scheveningen and Dragon structures are discussed in Chapter 22.  Family Three: Benoni  This small family is devoted to those structures in which Black confronts the queen's pawn opening with a ...c7-c5 strategy and White replies with d4-d5. Later, when Black challenges the centre with ...e7-e6 and ...exd5, White must choose between cxd5 and exd5. Chapter 12 is devoted to studying the first option, which is typically known as a Benoni-type position, while Chapter 13 studies the alternative exd5. The related Benko structure is discussed in Chapter 22.  Family Four: King's Indian  This family of five chapters is devoted to the multiple types of structure arising from the King's Indian Defence and its relatives. It is an extremely interesting and complex group of chapters to study, but it contains plenty of tactical and strategic ideas. This family encompasses Chapters 14 to 18. The related structures of the Closed Ruy Lopez and Lopez Formation are discussed in Chapter 22.  Family Five: French  This family of three chapters studies the pawn chains that typically arise in the French Defence. It should be noted that such structures often occur in the Sicilian, the anti-Sicilian, the English Opening, the Catalan and many others. It covers Chapters 19 to 21.  Miscellaneous Chapter  As you may see from the list above, Chapter 22 covers many structures. This chapter allows me to discuss structures which are in some sense too 'strategically limited' to deserve a full chapter, or simply not so popular. Still, this chapter presents some of the interesting points of these structures and deserves a close look.  Structure selection  Naturally, it would be impossible to cover every structure. It was a challenge to decide which structures were worthy of inclusion, and which ones were not. I gave priority to the following:  Strategic over tactical: I prefer discussing structures with a substantial strategic component. Structures like the Dragon are discussed only briefly in Chapter 22. The reason is that tactics and opening knowledge tend to predominate, offering fewer long-term plans for us to study.  Frequent over rare: I gave priority to those structures that arise more often, to offer a practical selection that the reader would be likely to encounter in play. Rare structures are not included.  Fixed over flexible: Plans often begin to form after something happens with the pawn structure. That is, pawns are traded, a pawn chain is formed or there is tension in the centre. This creates a semistable pawn structure. I only chose structures in which this was the case. If there is no pawn contact whatsoever, then multiple options remain open, but the game is likely to reach one of our structures at a later stage.  Generally relevant over specific: I tried to avoid structures that occur in only one opening. For this reason, I do not discuss the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, or the doubled pawn arising in the Trompowsky, or the Winawer or MacCutcheon variations of the French. I do mention the Benko structure in Chapter 22, but primarily because it is relevant to the asymmetric Benoni studied in Chapter 12.  Exercises  The book concludes with a collection of fifty positional and tactical exercises, which reinforce the ideas presented. I attempted to sort these problems from easiest to hardest, but this is merely my own evaluation. If the reader struggles with later exercises, he is likely to find inspiration by solving earlier problems. I provide detailed explanations to all of these exercises. In fact, some of these solutions convey pieces of knowledge that are not thoroughly developed in the corresponding chapter, in an attempt to keep this textbook concise and to make the exercises interesting. The reader is encouraged to first attempt the exercises, and then read these solutions as an additional chapter of supplemental examples.  Game selection  The most challenging aspect of writing this book was selecting suitable examples for the concepts I wanted to illustrate. I became so ambitious in my aim to provide a fine collection that I reviewed approximately 20,000 recent games. When I selected games, I prioritized:  - Quality of execution  - Tactical simplicity, when appropriate  - Recent games over older games  - Visually appealing games  I want this book to explain mistakes made by all levels of players. I certainly did not want to omit those mistakes the best players in the world could make. Excessive tactical complications often make the strategic message rather blurry. Therefore, I avoided sharp tactics whenever it was possible and reasonable. Recent games have obvious advantages over older games. First, the reader is unlikely to bore himself with something he already knows; second, recent games illustrate mistakes players make nowadays, instead of those they used to make in the past. By the past, I mean three, four or five decades ago when strategic knowledge was far less advanced than it is today. Finally, I made an effort to choose beautiful games whenever possible, simply because I would like the readers to enjoy this book.  How to use this book  I understand many readers have limited time and do not wish to read an entire book if they are only likely to encounter a few of the pawn structures I discuss. For this reason, chapters are largely self-contained, while similar chapters will be found close to one another and arranged in a logical sequence. I took great care in ordering chapters so that all required knowledge would be available when needed. Many pawn structures can transpose to another. If structure B is likely to transpose to structure A, then I mention structure A at an earlier stage in the book. When the reader studies structure B, he will be able to understand whether transposing to structure A is favourable or not. This makes the learning process run smoothly and comprehensively.  Nevertheless, I would recommend that readers study this book in its entirety even if their current repertoire is unlikely to include all of these structures. Learning new structures opens your mind to new ideas and could do wonders for your chess.  Prior works  I am aware that other authors have already discussed similar structures as I do in my book. This fact drove me to expand this book beyond my original objective. I studied previous works in depth, as my ambition was to produce the most detailed treatment on the subject yet. I am convinced this book will be a great contribution to the study of chess structures. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Isolani@@HeaderEnd@@  The isolated queen's pawn - referred to here as the isolani - is an extremely important pawn structure. It arises in many opening variations; the Queen's Gambit accepted, Slav, Tarrasch Defence, Sicilian Alapin or French Tarrasch to name a few. This structure is equally common with either colour, but for our discussion in this chapter we will assume it is White who has the isolani.  Generally speaking, White has better middlegame prospects, while Black has better prospects in an endgame. Therefore, White's main aim will be to build an attack, while Black's hope will be to neutralize such an attack and simplify the position, obtaining a superior endgame.  Let's discuss some specific plans:  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack. Most standard plans will include the moves Ne5, Bg5 and the battery Qd3-Bc2. In some cases a piece sacrifice on the kingside is needed to break through the defence. Rooks are typically placed on e1 and d1  (or c1)  , and a rook transfer via the third rank is possible.  2. Break in the centre with d4-d5, trading pawns and opening lines with an overwhelming initiative  (or even sacrificing a pawn with the same purpose)  .  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to win an endgame. In particular, exchange White's good bishop  (the light-squared bishop)  .  2. Place a knight on d5. This prevents the central break d4-d5, and controls some key squares. In an endgame a rook, bishop or even a king would be strong on this square.  As we have seen, the plans in this structure are logical and easy to understand. Playing these positions, on the other hand, can be tricky. Great precision is required when calculating, and a good positional understanding is necessary in order to judge when the isolani provides good attacking chances  (or other compensation)  and when it is simply a weakness.  The games in this chapter show all of these common plans in some form or another. The last two games illustrate an interesting rule for evaluating whether the isolani provides enough attacking chances. As we will learn, the key is whether the player who has the isolani possesses his good bishop. The chapter finishes with a short fragment explaining the power of an isolani which has advanced to the fifth rank. } 1. -- *

The break d4-d5 was a predominant theme in this game; which prevented many of Black's desired moves.  2. The alternative 18.Bh4 would have given a pleasent, slow-paced but steady advantage.  3. Although the piece sacrifice 18.Bxh6 only gives equality, it is justified in practice, as White's attack was far easier to play than Black's defence.

White's piece arrangement with pawns on e3/f3, Bf1, Bf2 and Nd4 was ideal. It covered most essential squares while maintaining a solid and dynamic position.   3. Black did not have a good response against the plan Rc3, Qc1 and b2-b3 followed by penetrating down the c-file. Therefore, Black's position was lost in practice ever since move 30. This means a defence was only possible assuming near-perfect play, which even a top-player like Bologan was unable to deliver. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Hanging Pawns@@HeaderEnd@@  The 'hanging pawns' structure arises in many openings and is closely related to the isolani. In fact, most hanging pawns arise from an isolani position, in which Black trades his knight on d5 for White's knight on c3. Later, White is likely to advance c3-c4 yielding the position in the diagram. Similar to the previous chapter, this structure is equally likely to arise with either colour, but for the moment we will assume it is White who has the hanging pawns. In general, White has better middlegame prospects due to his control of central squares and his spatial edge. Black, on the other hand, should aim for an endgame or a simplified position in which these pawns are likely to become a liability. In particular, if these pawns become blocked by Black's pieces, then they will become a crucial weakness accounting for an essentially lost position. Now, let's discuss specific ideas for both sides.  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack. Most plans will include the moves Ne5, Bc2, Qd3, and a likely rook transfer through the third rank, say with Re1-e3-h3.  2. Break in the centre with d4-d5, either to open lines for attack, or to create a powerful passed pawn on the d-file.  Black's plans  1. Trade off pieces atempting to neutralize the attack.  2. Pressure the central pawns, block them if possible.  3. Break the hanging pawns, either with ...b6-b5 or ...e6-e5. These breaks are not easy to carry out, especially because an experienced player will try and prevent them at all costs. However, if they can be accomplished they are generally very strong, as they weaken those squares covered by the hanging pawns, and often force White to accept an isolani under very unfavourable circumstances.  As the reader will notice, many ideas are shared between this structure and the previous one, and this should not be a surprise. These structures are members of the same family in a general sense. They are both open positions in which White enjoys a pleasant spatial advantage at the cost of some structural instability. Overall, I would say the standard hanging pawns position offers level chances and a complex game with winning chances for both sides. Precise calculation is often required to carry out  (or neutralize)  the attack and to find the right timing for the central breaks mentioned above.  The first two games in this chapter will illustrate how White may successfully break in the centre with d4-d5. In the first example, this break will create a decisive attack due to the opening of lines, while the second example will illustrate the power of a passed pawn advancing down the d-file. The third game is an illustration of White's attacking potential within a modified structure which often arises from the hanging pawns. The last three games in the chapter illustrate  (with reversed colours)  how Black may play against the hanging pawns. The first of these games illustrates the blocking of the hanging pawns, while the last two exemplify the breaks ...e6-e5 and ...b6-b5 respectively. } 1. -- *

It was not possible for Black just to break the hanging pawns with 16...e5. White's good piece placement rendered this move ineffective.  2. White's pair of bishops played a central role in many positions. They are very helpful in an open position such as with hanging pawns. Black seemingly underestimated the decisive d4-d5 break. It was necessary to prevent it, though passive defence would have been unpleasant as well. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Caro-Kann Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Caro-Kann formation often appears in the Caro-Kann Defence, the Scandinavian, and the Queen's Gambit Declined  (though with the white pawn already on c4)  after White plays e3-e4 and Black captures with ...d5xe4. This pawn trade has two major consequences:   (1)  White gains better control of the centre.   (2)  White has more space by having the d-pawn on the fourth rank.  This structure gives better chances to White in most cases, as Black's pieces are constrained. For this reason, Black's main task is to dispute White's central control by modifying the structure. Now let's discuss specific plans.  White's plans  The control of the centre opens up multiple opportunities for White everywhere on the board, such as:  1. Creating a direct kingside attack. This is often accompanied by placing a knight on the e5 outpost, or targeting the weak h7-pawn with the queen and a bishop from d3.  2. Gaining space with c3-c4, h2-h4 and harmoniously placing pieces to control the centre.  3. Playing c4-c5 to restrict Black's release break ...c6-c5, and to gain control of the d6-square. If White manages to keep Black's counterplay under control, the game will be slow paced and White could even be able to combine some of these plans while Black suffers through passive defence.  Black's plans  The main objective is to dispute White's centre and transform the structure. This can be achieved by:  1. Breaking in the centre with ...c6-c5 which usually produces a black 4-2  (kingside/queenside)  versus a white 3-3 pawn structure with roughly level chances.  2. Breaking up the centre with ...e6-e5 in order to obtain a symmetrical position after White captures with dxe5. This plan is rather unlikely to succeed as many of White's pieces control e5 from their natural squares  (d4-pawn, knight on f3, rook on e1, queen on e2)  .  3. Putting pressure on the d4-pawn once c3-c4 has been played.  4. Challenging White's control of the d5-square by playing ...b7-b5 once White has played c2-c4.  As the reader may notice, all of White's plans aim for an advantage, while Black's Plans 1 and 2 are essentially aimed at equalizing. Black's Plan 3 rarely works, as White is able to defend the d4-pawn in most positions. This is why White's position is somewhat superior. It should be noted that Black's Plan 1 is the most likely to be successfully achieved.  Outposts  Some would say Black can place a knight on his d5 outpost to compensate for White placing a knight on e5; this is certainly not the case. It is unlikely that Black's knight on d5 will create serious threats to White's position. Additionally, White can always push c3-c4 to get rid of this knight if it is absolutely necessary. In contrast, White's knight on e5 is very strong, as it creates threats against Black's king. Black cannot easily expel this knight since ...f7-f6 seriously weakens the kingside.  The first three games in this chapter illustrate how White may successfully carry our his Plans 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Then follow two games which are examples of how Black may successfully carry our the ...c6-c5 break. Finally, the sixth game in the chapter illustrates Black's plan to play ...b7-b5, though White wins the game after the c6-pawn becomes a weakness. } 1. -- *

{ As described in the introduction, Black's main plan in the Caro-Kann structure is to achieve the ...c6-c5 break. If this is achieved, White would probably capture with dxc5 after which we would obtain the pawn structure shown in this diagram. Throughout this chapter and subsequent chapters, I will refer to this structure as the 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure simply because of the distribution of pawns. This is a relatively simple pawn structure which often offers balanced chances. } 1. -- *

Be4 { Black resigns as he cannot prevent the loss of pawns on c6 and a4.   Final remarks  1. White's spatial advantage played a major role throughout the game. The reader should notice how Macieja avoided trading pieces when possible, for example with 11.Nf3.   2. Black was constantly forced to calculate White's speculative threats, such as 23.Bd3 followed by a potential 24.Bxg6 sacrifice. It is possible Macieja did not even waste a minute calculating such a sacrifice, though Black was obliged to assess whether the sacrifice worked, or otherwise prevent it just to be safe.   3. Black's desperate attempt with ...b7-b5 accelerated the downfall of his position, but the loss was imminent anyway, and White had great flexibility in choosing which winning plan to implement. } *

Throughout the entire game, White's d4-pawn was never vulnerable and the d5-square did not do much for Black, hence the c4-c5 move did not really weaken anything.   2. The move c4-c5 prevented essentially all of Black's attempts for counterplay. In particular, Black's light-squared bishop proved useless throughout the game.   3. 11...Be7 was a serious mistake, as it allowed White to seize control of the crucial d6-square, which was essential in White's victory.   4. Finally, this game serves as another example of White's positional advantage if the breaks ...c6-c5 and ...e6-e5 are impossible. Black's imprecise opening condemned him to this type of inferiority from the very beginning. } *
