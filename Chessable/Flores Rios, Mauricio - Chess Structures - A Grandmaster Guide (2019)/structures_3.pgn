{ @@HeaderStart@@Emilio Cordova – Igor Naumkin, Livigno 2010@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game illustrates Black’s chances for a direct checkmating attack. } 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 b6 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. O-O Be7 6. c4 O-O 7. b3 d5 8. Bb2 Nbd7 9. Qe2 a6 10. Rd1 Ne4 11. Ne1 { Not exactly a mistake, but certainly heading in the wrong direction. White intends to play f2-f3 in order to chase away Black’s strong knight on e4.   A healthier alternative was  11.Ne5  f5  12.f3  Nxe5  13.dxe5  Nc5  with roughly equal chances in the game Cordova – Ordaz Valdes, Monterrey 2010. } 11... f5 { A good decision, reinforcing the knight on e4, and going into a Stonewall-type position under favourable circumstances. The reader should note two essential characteristics in this position:  1. Black’s knight is already on e4, creating some chances for a kingside attack.  2. Black’s light-squared bishop can always become active after a timely ...dxc4 opening the a8-h1 diagonal.  For these two reasons, White should be particularly cautious, and not expect the usual solid position against the Stonewall. } 12. f3 { A careless move based on a tactical oversight.   It was better to play  12.Nd2  though after  12...Bd6  Black has a comfortable position. } 12... Bd6 { My favourite move in the game. This position perfectly illustrates Black’s attacking potential. White wanted to push the knight away in order to obtain a comfortable positional advantage, but Black simply leaves it there. Is it possible to take it? } 13. fxe4 { White does not want to admit that 12.f3 was simply a weakening move, hence he accepts the challenge. Unfortunately for him, Black’s attack is even stronger than it seems.   It was better to accept the mistake and play  13.Nc3  after which Black gains the initiative with:  13...Qh4  14.f4   but not  14.g3 ?  because of  14...Nxg3 !  15.hxg3  Bxg3  when White is completely helpless against the threat of  ...Rf6-g6  , and  16.Ba3  hoping to respond to  16...Rf6  with  17.Be7  , is simply answered by  16...c5  14...Ndf6  The position is about equal, but it is Black who can fight for the advantage. } 13... fxe4 14. Bc2 Qg5 { A very strong move, preparing ...Nf6-g4 to which White does not have a satisfactory defence despite having an extra piece. Black’s pawns on d5 and e4 are the key as they restrict the mobility of White’s forces.   It is possible that White expected  14...Qh4 ?  15.g3   but not  15.h3 ??  Qg3  followed by  ...Qh2#  15...Qh3  threatening to double rooks on the ^f-file and now  16.Qg2  Qh6  17.Qe2  Qh3  leads to a draw by repetition. } 15. Nd2 { At first sight, White seems to defend with:  15.g3  But after:  15...Nf6  Black threatens  ...Ng4  and  ...Rf2  or  ...Nh5xg3.  Now White’s problems become more apparent. A possible continuation is:  16.Ng2  Nh5   But not  16...Ng4 ?  17.Nf4  !.  17.Rf1   17.g4  Rf3 !  and Black wins after either  18.gxh5   or  18.Nd2  Qxg4.  Qxh5  17...Nxg3 !  18.hxg3  Qxg3  Threatening  ...Qh2#.  19.Rf4  g5  Winning the rook.   The best defence was trading bishops with:  15.Ba3  Bxa3   or  15...c5  16.Nd2  Nf6  with a strong attack  16.Nxa3  Nf6  17.cxd5   17.h3 ?  Nh5  -+ threatening  ...Ng3  and  ...Rf1  17...exd5  18.Nd3  White has to return the piece sooner or later.  18...exd3  19.Bxd3  Ng4  ∓ } 15... Nf6 16. Nef3 { The only move; White really does not have any other way to bring his pieces back to the defence, and a knight on f3 is very much needed to protect h2, and to block the f-file.   Even the similar move  16.Ndf3 ?  loses to:  16...Qh5  (threatening ...Bxh2+)  17.h3   or  17.Rd2  exf3  18.Nxf3  dxc4  19.bxc4  Ng4  20.h3  Rxf3 !  21.gxf3  Nh2  -+  17...exf3  18.Nxf3  Ne4  threatening  ...dxc4  and  ...Ng5  (or ...Ng3)  (.) } 16... exf3 17. Nxf3 Qh5 { The attack continues; the threat is ...Bxh2+. } 18. Re1 { Worse is  18.h3  Ne4  -+ as in the note above. } 18... dxc4 { Even Black’s light-squared bishop, the famous 'bad bishop” in the Stonewall, comes into the attack. } 19. e4 { White has nothing better than giving up a pawn in order to block the bishop on b7.   White cannot recapture with  19.bxc4  because of  19...Ng4  with a crushing attack.  20.h3  Rxf3 !  21.gxf3   21.hxg4 ??  Qh2#  21...Nh2  22.Rf1  Nxf3+  Mate is coming soon. } 19... cxb3 20. axb3 { Black’s strategy has been a success: he has an extra pawn for no compensation, and all his pieces actively contribute to the attack. I will leave the rest of the game with shorter comments as it is less relevant to the subject of this chapter. } 20... Bb4 21. Rf1 a5 22. Rac1 c5 { Undermining White’s control of the centre. } 23. Bd3 { A better defence was:  23.Rcd1  cxd4  24.Bxd4  Bc5  ∓ } 23... Rad8 { The d4-pawn has become vulnerable. } 24. h3 { Weakening the position decisively. It was safer to 'sit and wait” with  24.Rc2  although Black can make progress slowly with:  24...Rd7  25.Rd1  Rfd8  ∓ } 24... Qh6 { Making room for the knight transfer ...Nh5-g3  (or f4)  . } 25. Bb1 Nh5 { Black’s multiple threats decide the game. } 26. Ne5 Nf4 27. Qg4 Bd2 28. Kh2 Nh5 { But not  28...Bxc1 ??  29.Bxc1  ± losing the knight on  f4. } 29. g3 { 29.Rcd1  is useless because of:  29...Rf4 !  30.Qe2   or  30.Rxf4  Qxf4+  31.Qxf4  Bxf4+  32.Kg1  Bxe5  30...Rxf1  31.Rxf1  Bf4+  32.Kg1  Ng3 } 29... Ba6 { Winning the ^f-file.   But not  29...Bxc1 ??  30.Bxc1  when Black’s queen is trapped. } 30. Rxf8+ { 30.Bd3  Bxd3  31.Nxd3  Bxc1  32.Bxc1  Qg6  and wins. } 30... Rxf8 31. Rg1 Be3 32.

The key to Black’s successful attack was his e4-pawn, which prevented White from bringing pieces into the defence.  2. It is worth studying how Black’s attack was conducted while having control of the centre. Imagine how difficult it would have been to create threats if White had been able to place a knight on e5. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Levon Aronian – Evgeny Tomashevsky, FIDE World Cup, Tromsø 2013@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game is an example of Black’s light-squared bishop becoming powerful after the manoeuvre ...Bd7-e8-h5. } 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. e3 Bd6 5. Bd3 f5 6. O-O Nf6 7. b3 Qe7 { So far we have been following Cvitan – Doric from before. } 8. Ne5 { This is a rare move order, though Ne5 is a standard move in general in this opening.   As we mentioned previously, a more popular choice is  8.Bb2  O-O  and now either  9.Nc3   or  9.Qc1 !?  followed by  Ba3. } 8... O-O 9. Bb2 Bd7 10. Nc3 Be8 { The manoeuvre ...Bc8-d7-e8 is standard in this position. The light-squared bishop is of little use on c8, so Tomashevsky brings the bishop to e8 where it is ready to be activated with ...Bh5 once the right moment comes. } 11. cxd5 { An alternative was  11.Ne2 !?  which is similar to the Cvitan – Doric game.   If  11.Qc2  Black can simply continue with:  11...Nbd7  12.cxd5   or  12.Ne2 !?  Rc8  12...exd5  13.f4   but not  13.Nxd7 ?

Rc1 Nc6 { The reader should note that White cannot really play for more than equality in this position. The knight on e5 is not particularly useful, and Black’s bishop on e8 is not more restricted than White’s bishop on b2. } 13. Nb5 Bb4 14. a3 Ba5 15. Be2 a6 16. Nc3 Ne4 17. b4 { But not  17.f3 ?  losing a pawn after:  17...Nxc3  18.Bxc3  Bxc3  19.Rxc3  Nxe5  20.dxe5  Qxa3  ∓ } 17... Bc7 18. Nxe4 { It is generally inconvenient for White to take on e4 before placing a pawn on f4.   It was healthier to accept equality with  18.f4  Nxe5  19.fxe5  Bc6  20.Nxe4  fxe4  with a probable draw. } 18... fxe4 { Now Black has pressure down the ^f-file, with the f2-pawn being quite vulnerable. } 19.

White gains compensation for the pawn after:  22.Rc7  Rf7  23.Rxf7  Nxf7  24.f4 !?   But  21...Rd8 !?  allows Black to keep a tiny advantage.  22.Bg4  Bd7  23.Bh5 !  This curious move is the key.  23...g6   Or  23...Re7  24.Qg4  !.  24.Be2  White is holding, since  24...Nxe5 ?  now fails to:  25.h4 !  Qf6  26.Qd4  +- } 21... Bh5 { ∓ I find it difficult to believe that throughout the past four moves Aronian seems to have been heading in this direction voluntarily. He had a clear chance to equalize with 18.f4, and even 19.f4 was better than this position. Black’s strategy has succeeded in every way. Let’s spell out why:  1. Black does not have to worry about a weak e5-square. Instead, White has a weak e5-pawn to worry about.  2. There is pressure down the ^f-file, thanks to the strong pawn on e4.   3. Black has managed to activate his bad bishop with ...Bd7-e8-h5.   4. White’s bishop on b2 is practically useless at the moment. } 22. f3 { Trading light-squared bishops seems quite dangerous:  22.Bxh5  Qxh5  For example:  23.Qd1   Instead, the careless  23.h3 ?  is met by the strong:  23...Rf3 !  24.Kh2   24.gxf3 ??

Bxe2  23.Qxe2  Rf7  ∓ since the e5-pawn is about to fall. } 22... Qh6 { A prophylactic move, preparing ...exf3 followed by doubling rooks on the ^f-file.   The variation  22...exf3  23.gxf3  Rf5 ?  24.f4 !  illustrates the importance of playing  22...Qh6. Now  24...Qh6  25.Qc2  and White solves most of his problems. } 23. Rce1 exf3 24. gxf3 Rf7 25. Bc1 { No better is  25.f4  Bxe2  26.Rxe2  Ne7 !  27.Rg2  Nf5  ∓ since the bishop on  b2  is no opponent for a knight on  f5.   An alternative was  25.Qd3  but after  25...Ne7  (threatening ...Nf5)  26.e4  Qf4  ∓ White’s position is very uncomfortable. } 25... Bg6 { There is nothing wrong with this move, but there was a more immediate win.   Black could have decided the game with the precise:  25...Nxe5 !  26.e4  Bxf3+ !  This shot was probably missed by both players   instead  26...Qf6 ?  gives away most of the advantage after  27.exd5  exd5  28.Bb2  =+  27.Bxf3  Qh3  Black goes into a winning endgame after the relatively forced line:  28.exd5  Rxf3  29.Rxf3  Nxf3  30.Bf4  Qg4  31.Rf1  Qxf4  32.Rxf3  Qc1+  33.Kg2  Qg5+  34.Rg3  Qd2+  35.Kh3  exd5  -+ } 26. e4 Qh3 27. exd5 Nd4 28.

Qf2 Qg4+ { An interesting alternative; instead of deciding the game immediately through tactical means, Tomashevsky heads into a won endgame, where he displays his positional mastery in an impeccable way.   A more tactical approach was  31...Raf8 !  32.dxe6  Qxe6  33.Qg3  Bc6  with a winning attack. } 32. Qg3 Qxg3+ 33. hxg3 Bxd5 { The endgame is won, since White has absolutely nothing to aim for, while Black has many pawns to attack, such as a3, e5 and g3. Throughout the remaining part of the game, the reader should notice how Black’s ‘bad’ bishop is actually extremely strong, while White’s bishop is relatively useless in most variations. The position is not exactly a model of the Stonewall anymore, but it certainly deserves study as an example of endgame technique. } 34. Be3 a5 35. b5 a4 { Disconnecting the queenside pawns. Tomashevsky knows his pawns on b7 and a4 cannot be captured, hence he will always have pawns on both flanks, which is often a prerequisite for winning. } 36. Rxf7 Kxf7 37. Rf1+ Kg6 38.

Rg1  -+  47...Ra1  48.Bc5  g5 !?  49.Rc2  Rh1  50.Rc1  Rh2+  51.Kd3  Kg6  Followed by  ...Kh5-g4. } 43... Ra2 { And now White’s position simply falls apart. } 44. Bc1 { Instead  44.Rd7 ?  loses on the spot after:  44...Rxa3  45.Rxb7  Bd5 !  Attacking rook and bishop.  46.Bc1  Rxg3  -+ } 44... Rg2 45. Bf4 Rg1+ 46. Kd2 Ra1 { The a3-pawn falls, and the rest is simple for Black. } 47. Kc3 { Not  47.Rd7 ??  Rd1  +-+. } 47... Rxa3 48. Kb4 Ra1 49. Bd2 { 49.Rd7  Bd5  -+ } 49... Bd5 50. Bc3 Ra2 51. Rd3 Kg6 52. Rd4 a3 53. Rd3 Kf5 54. Bd2 Ra1 55. Bc3 Ra2 56. Bd2 Ke4 57. Re3+ Kd4 58. Bc1 Rc2 { Final remarks  1. The usefulness of Black’s bishop manoeuvre is best illustrated in the note to White’s 19th move. Aronian was probably dissatisfied with this position and so chose a different alternative which proved to be worse.  2. In general, the pawn structure transformations which occurred on moves 18-20 do not help White, as the e5-square becomes unavailable and particularly the e5-pawn becomes a target while Black lacks clear weaknesses. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Grünfeld Centre@@HeaderEnd@@  The structure studied in this chapter typically arises from the Grünfeld Defence, and occasionally in the Nimzo-Indian Defence, in which case the e7-pawn will be on e6, but this does not affect the essence of the strategy. It rarely occurs with reversed colours unless White is deliberately attempting to play a Grünfeld with an extra tempo. Although there is central tension in the position presented, the most likely outcome is that pawns will be traded on d4, after which the c-file will be open, leaving White with a central pawn majority and Black with a queenside pawn majority. This will be a central theme across all positions of this type. Let's outline plans for each side:  White's plans  1. Create a central passed pawn with d4-d5, dominate the centre, gain space.  2. Create a kingside attack, which will probably include the moves h2-h4-h5 and e4-e5 to gain control of the f6-square, which is usually weakened when Black develops his bishop on g7.  Black's plans  1. Create a queenside passed pawn, especially after some simplifications.  2. Pressure the centre, place a rook on the d-file and find tactical resources associated with the open position.  In general White will get pretty good middlegame opportunities since he dominates the centre and has a little more space. This advantage disappears rather easily, as the position is open and Black has multiple opportunities to trade off pieces heading into a good endgame. One major factor in this position is the control of the c-file. If White controls the c-file it will be easier for him to expand, to create a passed pawn, to neutralize Black's play. Likewise, if Black controls the open file, White's central or kingside play will face many difficulties. One may say that open files are always important, which is often true. But in this position the open file is even more important than usual - it is essential.  The first three games in this chapter will illustrate the importance of the c-file, and through these examples, we will see how White can create a central passed pawn and win the game. In the third game, it is Black who creates pressure by controlling the c-file and eventually obtains a near-winning endgame. The last two games are devoted to the study of White attacking with the e4-e5 advance. In the first of these White's strategy proves successful, while in the second example Black manages to neutralize the threats to obtain a very superior endgame which is won with high class.  The first example in this chapter is the 17th game from the World Championship match of 1990. This game is annotated in the Mega Database by GMs Ftacnik and Gurevich. I shall fast-forward through the opening to reach the position of interest. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Wesley So – Mauricio Flores Rios, Princeton 2012@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objectives:  1. This game is a modern execution of the ideas we studied in the previous game.  2. Once again, the c-file, the entrance on the c6-square, and the potential for a passed pawn decide the game in White’s favour. } 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 c5 8. Rb1 O-O 9. Be2 b6 { More common is  9...cxd4  10.cxd4  Qa5+  11.Bd2  Qxa2  with sharp theoretical complications. } 10. O-O Bb7 11. Qd3 cxd4 { The beginning of a mistaken plan. I somehow wanted to play safe in this game by trading several pieces early on, and hoping for an easy draw. Let’s see what happened.   A better alternative was the standard  11...e6  12.Bg5  Qc7  13.Qe3  Nd7  14.e5  with a typical Grünfeld position which has occurred in over 50 games. } 12. cxd4 Ba6 13. Qe3 Bxe2 14. Qxe2 Nc6 15. d5 Nd4 16. Nxd4 Bxd4 { And here I was. After trading three minor pieces I thought my position was very close to equal, and heading for a relatively easy draw. There is great similarity between this position and the previous game, but unfortunately for me, I was unfamiliar with that game at the time, hence I was in unknown territory from a strategic perspective and I did not yet know how bad my position was.  The reader should carefully examine this position and appreciate Black’s difficulties. First, one of White’s main plans in this pawn structure is the creation of a passed pawn on the d-file, which Wesley is not very far from, since his d-pawn has already reached d5. Second, the c6-square is weakened, which probably will help White gain control of the c-file, just as in the previous game. Finally, Black’s counterplay is often based on advancing his majority on the queenside, but we know this is not going to happen soon enough; thus Black is just playing a waiting game, hoping to survive. Overall, this position is probably just a slight advantage for White, but it is extremely difficult for Black to play, as there is not a clear-cut plan, and there are many things to worry about. } 17. Rd1 { Gaining a tempo to support the potential e4-e5 and d5-d6.   An interesting alternative is:  17.Bh6 !?  Bg7  18.Bxg7  Kxg7  19.Rbc1  Rc8  20.Rc6 !  Just as in the previous game.  20...Rxc6  21.dxc6  Qc7  22.Rc1  ± With perfect play, it is impossible to say if this is a forced win or just a draw. But White can comfortably play for a win for as long as he wants to, and should expect to score about 80% of the points, as passive defence is always difficult. As an example, I offer this variation:  22...Rd8  23.e5  e6  24.g3  Rc8  25.h4  Rd8  26.Qe3  Rc8  27.Qd4  Rd8  28.Qd6 !  Rxd6 ?   or  28...Rc8  29.Kg2  ±  29.exd6  Qxd6  30.c7  +- } 17... Bg7 { Or  17...Be5  18.Bh6   18.f4 ?!  does not work so well after  18...Bd6  19.e5  Bc5+  20.Kh1  Qd7  followed by  ...Qf5  where Black is doing fine  18...Re8  19.Rbc1  += and again, it is similar to the previous game.   The alternative  17...Bc5 ?!  blocking the c-file can be met by  18.Bh6  Re8  19.e5  when White has good attacking prospects, aside from the potential threat of creating a central passed pawn. } 18. Ba3 { Preparing White’s two main ideas: the creation of a passed pawn with e4-e5 and d5-d6, and the control of the c-file with Rb1-c1-c6. Black cannot prevent both. } 18... Be5 { At this point I started to realize that I was in serious trouble, since I had lost the c-file.   In particular, I was disappointed to realize that after  18...Qd7  19.e5  Black has nothing to do other than wait, while White has a pleasant choice between the strong breaks e5-e6 and d5-d6.  19...Rfe8  20.Qe4  Rac8  21.g3 !?  (preparing f2-f4 gaining more space)  21...Rc3  22.Bb2  Rc5  23.Rbc1  Black is inferior, and must always watch out for tactical shots. For example  23...Rec8 ?  runs into:  24.e6 !  fxe6   better is  24...Qd6  ±  25.dxe6  And now  25...Qc6 ?  loses after  26.Rxc5  bxc5  27.Rd8+ !  winning the queen, or mating after  27...Bf8  28.Qe5. } 19. Rbc1 Qd7 20. Rc6 { Following Karpov’s model, White takes control of the c-file. The machine only gives a small advantage to White, but I can testify this feels a lot worse during a live game, particularly since I did not know how to wait without further damaging my position. } 20... Rfc8 21. Qc2 e6 { This is just a sign of desperation, damaging my own position by helping White obtain a passed pawn on the d-file.   No good is  21...Rxc6 ?  22.dxc6  Qe8  23.Rd7  when the c6-pawn and the seventh-rank invasion decide the game.   It was better to wait with  21...Rab8  but after  22.g3  Black’s position is unpleasant, facing the potential threat f2-f4 and e4-e5. A possible continuation is  22...b5  23.Bb4  Qd8  24.f4  Bg7  25.e5  ± followed by e5-e6 or d5-d6 to create a passed pawn. } 22. g3 exd5 23. exd5 h5 { My dreams were crushed too soon after the strong: } 24. Re1 { ± The bishop on e5 suddenly becomes vulnerable. } 24... Re8 { If  24...Bg7  25.Re7  Qg4  26.d6  the passed d-pawn decides the game. } 25. d6 Rec8 { I played this instantly as I was already under some time pressure. } 26. Rc7 { I completely missed this nice tactical blow which gives White a decisive advantage.   I was hoping for  26.Rxc8+ ?  Rxc8  27.Qe4  Bf6  when Black’s position seems defendable, though White is still better. } 26... Rxc7 27. dxc7 Qxc7 { Not  27...Bxc7 ?  28.Re7  and White wins at once. } 28. Qe4 { Attacking the rook and the bishop. } 28... Re8 29. Bb2 { This is the point. Black is now forced to give up an exchange obtaining a lost position. } 29... Bxb2 { Even worse is:  29...f6 ?  30.Qxg6+  Kf8   30...Qg7 ?  31.Qxe8+  31.Ba3+  +- } 30. Qxe8+ Kg7 31. Re7 Qc1+ 32. Kg2 Qc4 33. Rxa7 Qd5+ { More stubborn was  33...h4  !?. } 34. f3 Qc4 35.

Rc7 Kh6 44. Qc1 { Final remarks  1. The message of this game is very similar to the previous one. In essence, the c-file plays a crucial role in this type of structure. Without it, Black will be limited to a very difficult, passive defence.  2. Most importantly, this game illustrates the importance of studying model games for each structure, as we do in this book. Had I known the Karpov – Kasparov game beforehand, I certainly would have known how to play this position type, and I would have known what variations to avoid. } *

The reader should compare this position to the previous two games and understand why White’s move is a mistake. In these games, particularly in So – Flores, White had two strong plans in hand:   creating a passed pawn on the d-file, and controlling the c-file with his major pieces. In this position Black is well prepared to meet both plans, and it is White who does not have the time to fight for the c-file, due to the vulnerability of his central pawns.   A sound decision was  18.Rfd1  Nf6  19.Rac1  with level chances.   Or  18.c4 !?  cxd4  19.exd4  with a hanging pawns structure, although the central pawns might become vulnerable as the game is already simplified. } 18... Nf6 19.

After  21...Rc3  22.Rae1  Qd7 !?  23.Qxd7  Rxd7  =+ White has to defend an inferior endgame. } 21... Rc2 { Black is certainly not going to miss a chance to invade the seventh rank. } 22. h3 Rdc8 23.

The key to this game was the timely e4-e5 advance, which gave White all the benefits but none of the drawbacks of this move.  2. The disadvantage in placing a knight on a5 is that after e4-e5 it takes many moves to reach the d5-square. By the time this knight reached d5, Black’s camp was already far too weakened. } *

Generally speaking, the e4-e5 advance is double-edged in the Grunfeld structure. On the positive side, it restricts the action of the g7-bishop and creates some attacking chances on the kingside. On the negative side, it may permanently weaken the d5 square, and it often gives up the possibility of creating a passed d-pawn, as Black can simply neutralize the majority with the standard ...e7-e6. This position is different, and the key is the lack of Blacks light-squared bishop and the misplacement of Blacks knight, many moves away from the d5-square. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Yuri Vovk – Andrei Volokitin, Kiev 2012@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objectives:  1. This game illustrates how Black may neutralize White’s kingside attack after e4-e5 has been played.  2. After Black neutralizes such an attack, we arrive in a superior endgame which illustrates the advantage of having a remote pawn majority. } 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 c5 8. Ne2 Nc6 9. Be3 O-O 10. O-O Na5 11. Bd3 b6 12. Rc1 { So far we have been following theory quite closely, and now: } 12... e6 { This is somewhat rare, but still a good move and a standard one in Black’s set-up.   More common is  12...cxd4  13.cxd4  e6  14.Qd2  Bb7  with typical Grünfeld play.   12...e5 !?  is also possible. } 13. Qd2 { If  13.dxc5  Black is often ready to play with compensation for the pawn after  13...Qc7 !  14.cxb6  axb6  with level chances, since the c3- and a2-pawns are rather weak. For example,  15.Rb1  Nc4  16.Bxc4  Qxc4  17.Rxb6 ?!   better is  17.Rb4  Qxa2 =  17...Qxe4 !?  with slightly better chances for Black. } 13... Bb7 14. Bg5 { Again, Black is fine after  14.dxc5  Qc7  15.cxb6  axb6.   Another option was  14.Rfd1  cxd4  15.cxd4  Qd7  when the position is quite flexible. A possible continuation is  16.Bh6  Bxh6  17.Qxh6  Rac8  18.h4  Rxc1  19.Rxc1  Nc6 !?  with a balanced game. } 14... Qd6 15. e5 { A double-edged decision that is typical in this position.   Again the conservative  15.Rfd1  was possible, with level chances. } 15... Qd7 { This is a critical position in the game. By advancing e4-e5, White has created some attacking prospects on the kingside, while at same time weakening the d5-square and losing the option of creating a passed pawn on the d-file. The reader should compare this position to the previous game, and realize that Black is much better prepared to meet this advance in this position, since he does have a light-squared bishop to create counterplay down the a8-h1 diagonal. Overall, chances are approximately balanced. } 16. Qe3 { Preparing the manoeuvre Ng3-e4-f6.  This plan is reasonable, but somewhat slow.   An alternative was  16.h4  Rfc8  17.h5  cxd4  18.cxd4  Rxc1  19.Rxc1  Nc6   if  19...Rc8 ?!  20.Rxc8+  Qxc8  21.Bf6  += and Black experiences some problems  20.Bb1   but not  20.Be4 ?  Nxd4 !  20...Rc8  21.Rc3  Ne7 !?  with level chances.   Or  16.Bf6  cxd4   but not  16...Bxf6 ?!  17.exf6  with the threat Qh6-g7#  17.cxd4  Rac8  18.h4 !?  with a balanced game. } 16... Rac8 17. Ng3 cxd4 18. cxd4 Rxc1 19. Rxc1 Nc6 { Attacking the d4-pawn, preventing White from completing the plan with Ne4-f6, and manoeuvring the knight to d5 via b4.

Bxe4 24. Bxg7 Kxg7 { There is no point in gaining a pawn with  24...Bxg2 ?!  because of  25.Bh6 !  and now it is Black who must play for a draw due to the strong threats against his king. } 25. Nxe4 { The position has been simplified and White’s plan e4-e5 has only half worked, as Black seems to have enough resources to defend. Still, White’s chances should not be underestimated, as there are threats associated with h4-h5-h6, Qf3-f6, Nd6 etc. } 25... Nd5 { The most precise in my opinion, keeping White’s kingside initiative under control, and playing on for the win.   25...Nxa2 !?  White forces a draw after:  26.Qf3 !   But not:  26.h5 ??  Qc1+  -+  26...Nb4  27.Nd6  Qd7  28.Qa8 !  Threatening  Ne8  winning; the only defence is:  28...Qc6 !   If  28...Nd5 ?  29.Ne8+  Kh6  30.g4  when Black is helpless against the checkmate threats. Say, after:  30...Qe7   30...b5  31.Nf6  Nxf6  32.Qf8#  31.Nf6 !  Nxf6  32.exf6  Qxf6  33.g5+  +-  29.Qxa7  Qc1+  30.Kh2  Qf4+  31.Kg1  Qc1+ =  With a perpetual check. } 26. Nd6 { This is not technically a mistake, though it is heading in the wrong direction; White should not swap queens.   A healthier decision was  26.Qd2 !?  Qc4  27.h5  with approximately level chances, say after  27...h6   27...a5 ?!  28.h6+  +=  28.hxg6  fxg6  29.g3  a5  30.Nd6  Qc3  31.Qd1 =  when Black cannot easily advance his queenside majority due to potential kingside threats. White should not have trouble securing a draw. } 26... Qc3 { The endgame after  26...Nxe3 ?!  27.Nxc8  Nc2  28.Nxa7  Nxd4  is just a draw as Black has lost his majority on the queenside, and the weak d4-pawn is off the board. } 27. Qxc3 { Going into a very difficult endgame.   27.Qe4 !  was necessary, though Black can play for a win without risk after:  27...b5 !   another option is  27...h5 !?  , but grabbing the pawn with  27...Qa1+  28.Kh2  Qxa2  only yields a draw after  29.Qf3 !  f5  30.exf6+  Nxf6  31.Qb7+  Kh6  32.Nf7+  Kg7  33.Nd6+  with a perpetual check  For example:  28.Nxb5 ?   correct is  28.g3  with objective equality, though accuracy is required from White  28...Qc1+  29.Kh2  Qb2  30.Nd6  Qxf2  ∓ } 27... Nxc3 { The reader should closely examine this endgame, as it reflects Black’s strategy in its pure form. The plan was to simplify the position and neutralize the kingside attack in order to go into an endgame with these characteristics. Black will obtain a remote passed pawn, probably on the a-file, while White cannot advance his extra pawn on d4. This position is an example of White’s biggest fears when playing the double-edged e4-e5. It is possible that Vovk estimated that he should be able to hold this position, but this task is actually very far from trivial as we shall see. } 28. Nc8 { The alternative  28.Kf1  Nxa2  29.Nc8  a5  30.Nxb6  Nc3  transposes to the game, while  28.a3 ?  loses a pawn after  28...Ne2+  29.Kf1  Nxd4. } 28... a5 { Black chooses to keep the a-pawn, as it is further away from White’s king.   If  28...Nxa2 ?  29.Nxa7  Nc3  30.Kf1  b5  31.Nc6  White has a much easier time holding the game. } 29. Nxb6 Nxa2 30.

Na3 { Preventing ...Nb5 followed by ...a4-a3. White’s knight is completely tied to stopping the a-pawn and will not make another move in the game. Since move 27 everything has been pretty much forced, and now Black chooses a strong plan to proceed. } 32... Kh6 { Intending to invade the kingside. White faces a very difficult dilemma: should he race to the queenside, attempting to capture the a-pawn, and then try to return to the kingside before it is too late? Or should he wait on the kingside, risking zugzwang? } 33. g4 { The decisive mistake, attempting to prevent the invasion, but also giving Black nice tactical resources as we will see.   If  33.Ke1  Black wins neatly with  33...Kh5  34.Kd2  Nd5  35.g3  Kg4  36.Ke2  h5  when White will fall into zugzwang after the nice sequence:  37.Nc2  Kh3  38.Kf3  Kh2  39.Ke2   39.g4 ?  Kh3  -+  39...Kg2  40.Ne1+  Kh3  41.Nc2  Kg4 !  42.Na3  Ne7  43.Nc2  Nf5  Zugzwang! White is forced to give up the f3-square:  44.Ke1  Kf3  45.Kf1  Ke4  -+   The best defence was  33.g3  g5  34.hxg5+  Kxg5  35.f3 !  attempting to create a barrier against Black’s king, though White’s position remains difficult after  35...Nd5 !?  ∓ attempting to follow up with  ...Ne7-f5  , in addition to a well-timed  ...h5-h4. } 33... Kg7 { The position is already winning for Black, but I will not call it  ”-+” until it is a little clearer. } 34. Ke1 { Another attempt was  34.f3  h5  35.Kg2  keeping an eye on the kingside, though after  35...Kf8 !?  Black’s king will march to the queenside decisively. For example:  36.Kf1  Ke8  37.Ke1   waiting on the kingside with  37.Kg2  only makes things easier after  37...Kd7  38.Kf2  Nd5  39.Ke2  Kc6  40.Kf2  Kb6  followed by  ...Ka5-b4  winning  37...g5 !  Winning in similar fashion to the game. } 34... h5 35. Kd2 { If  35.gxh5  gxh5  36.Kd2  Nd5  37.Nc4  Kg6  Black wins easily after  ...Kf5-g4xh4  making the h-pawn passed.   Or  35.g5  Nd5  36.Kd2  Ne7  followed by  ...Nf5  winning. } 35... g5 { -+ A very pretty blow, creating a new passed pawn on the h-file. } 36. hxg5 h4 37. Ke1 { If  37.Ke3  h3  38.Kf3  Ne2  then White’s king is paralyzed, and the game is lost after  ...Kg6xg5-h4  and ...Nf4; if  39.Kxe2 ?  h2. } 37... h3 38. Kf1 Kg6 39. f4 { 39.Kg1  Kxg5  40.Kh2  Kxg4  and wins. } 39... Nd5 40. Kf2 Nxf4 { Final remarks  1. The key moment in the game was after 26...Qc3. White’s kingside play had not been completely neutralized  (there were at least chances for perpetual check)  , hence White should have kept the queens on.  2. It is possible that White did not properly evaluate the knight ending. The strength of a remote passed pawn should not be underestimated.  3. The move 28...a5 ! was very important, choosing to keep a passed a-pawn rather than a b-pawn, because the further away the pawn is from the white king, the harder it is to stop it.  4. Black’s creation of a kingside passed pawn with 35...g5 ! is a beautiful illustration of the concept of creating two fronts, which defined the game. } *

For example, we can obtain this structure after the sequence  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5.  This structure deserves careful study as the recapture exd5 dramatically changes the character of the game. Even players of the highest level transform their position with this recapture without properly assessing their chances in the resulting position. This structure provides a natural imbalance and offers interesting chances to both sides. The main plans are:  White's plans  1. Advance the queenside majority with b2-b4 and c2-c4-c5.  2. On some occasions, after Black has played ...f7-f5, it is also possible to place a bishop along the ^bl-h7 diagonal and play g2-g4 breaking up Black's structure. This plan is rare, but when it works it does so spectacularly well.  Black's plans  1. Expand on the kingside with ...f7-f5 and develop a kingside attack.  2. Restrict or undermine White's queenside expansion with a potential ...b7-b5.  Bad bishops  A recurring theme in these positions is the fight between White's light-squared bishop and Black's dark-squared bishop. Both of these bishops are considered bad according to classical strategic theory, as they run on the same colour as their respective most-advanced pawns  (on d5 for White, e5 for Black)  . As we will learn in this chapter, Black's dark-squared bishop is not bad at all, while White's bishop is often restricted and even useless in some positions. This is a rule to be remembered. General strategy books would not teach us this rule, but we should remember it as an essential strategic element in this particular structure.  The first game in this chapter is the relatively well-known game Grischuk - Zhang Zhong from 2001, in which White carries out a powerful queenside expansion to create a winning passed pawn. Later Zhang Zhong manages to create illustrative kingside counterplay which emphasizes Black's many attacking possibilities. The second game is an example of White's queenside expansion, followed by a strong kingside break with g2-g4. The third game is one from my own experience: a race between Black's kingside attack and White's passed central pawns. The last two games illustrate Black's plans in the fight between the bishops. The first of these examples is a positional treatment, while the second is a sharp tactical approach, both yielding convincing victories to Black. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Mauricio Flores Rios – Neuris Delgado, American Continental Championship 2009@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game is an interesting example of Black’s kingside attack against White’s passed central pawns. } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. f3 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3 O-O 9. Qd2 Be6 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. exd5 Nb8 { We have reached the thematic position. White will try to expand on the queenside with the usual c2-c4-c5. } 12. Be2 Nbd7 13. Na5 { Opening the way for b2-b4. } 13... Qc7 14. c4 { Similar is:  14.O-O  Bd8 !  15.b4   of course, returning with the knight would be inconsistent:  15.Nb3 ?!  Nb6 !  16.Bxb6  Qxb6+  17.Kh1  a5  =+  15...Qb8 !  Threatening  ...Bxa5  destroying White’s queenside structure.  16.Nb3  Bb6 ! =  Trading dark-squared bishops ensures a good position for Black, as in the game Cubas – Delgado Ramirez, Asuncion 2010. } 14... Nh5 { This ambitious move is typical, opening the way for ...f7-f5. The resulting position is objectively preferable for White, but rather complicated in a practical game.   Simpler and somewhat preferable was  14...Bd8 !?  15.b4  Qc8  16.Nb3  Bb6  trading dark-squared bishops with level chances in Kernazhitsky – Chernyshov, Zalakaros 2005, since after  17.c5  dxc5  18.Rc1  then simply  18...c4 !  =+. } 15. b4 { A precise move order.   Weaker is  15.O-O  Nf4  16.b4   but not  16.Bd1 ?!  because of  16...Bd8 !  17.b4  Qc8  18.Nb3  Qxc4  16...Nxe2+  17.Qxe2  f5  with level chances. } 15... f5 { White is ready to meet  15...Nf4  with  16.Bd1  !. It is a good idea to keep this bishop on the board, for example after  16...f5  17.Rc1  Rf7  18.O-O  ± Black is in trouble, due to the threat of  Bb3  followed by c4-c5. } 16. O-O Rf6 { This plan is interesting but somewhat too slow.   An alternative was  16...Rae8  17.Rac1  b6  18.Nc6  Bh4  with a complicated position. } 17. Rfd1 Rg6 18. Rac1 { Preparing a c4-c5 break. } 18... b6 { During the game I thought at first that this was an excellent decision, as I had to decide between passively going back to b3, or placing my knight on c6. I was unsure if the knight on c6 would be useful at all, but fortunately for me, I found a tactical resource to refute Black’s plan.   An alternative was  18...Nf4  19.Bxf4  exf4  20.Kh1  ± when Black is likely to lose a pawn on the kingside, but there is some counterplay associated with the control of the dark squares.   If Black simply waits with  18...Rf8 ?!  then  19.c5 !  opens the queenside favourably. } 19. Nc6 { The key to this move becomes clear in the next two moves.   Incorrect is  19.Nb3 ?  Since c4-c5 is no longer strong, and Black may develop a strong kingside initiative, such as:  19...Qd8   Another option is:  19...Rf8 !?  20.Kh1   Or  20.Bd3  e4 !  21.fxe4  f4  22.Bd4  f3  with attacking chances for Black.  20...Bh4  21.Bd3  e4  22.fxe4  f4  There is nothing better than giving up the exchange with:  23.Bxf4   Bad is  23.Bd4 ?  f3 !  with a winning attack, since  24.gxf3 ?!  loses to  24...Ng3+ !!  25.hxg3  Bxg3  followed by  ...Qh4  deciding the game.  23...Nxf4  24.Qxf4  Bg5  25.Qf2  Bxc1  26.Rxc1  Ne5  =+ } 19... Bh4 20. Bd3 Rf8 { The alternative was  20...f4  21.Bf2  Bxf2+  22.Qxf2  ± followed by a2-a4-a5 with very good prospects. } 21. Qc2 { Unexpectedly winning a pawn, since f5 cannot be protected. } 21... e4 { A good decision: Black has to give up a pawn, but does it in the form of a typical sacrifice obtaining some compensation.   But not  21...Rgf6 ?  22.Ne7+.  This is the point of White’s 19th move, which was probably missed by Black:  22...Kh8  23.Nxf5  Winning even more material. } 22. fxe4 { Certainly not the right way to make use of the advantage, as it allows Black good compensation.   22.Be2 !  was accurate, forcing material gain under better circumstances:  22...f4   if  22...exf3 ?  23.Bxf3  Bg5  24.Bxg5  Rxg5  25.h4 !  +-  23.Qxe4 !  I missed this move, when White should be winning, though Black retains some practical chances. } 22... f4 { The reader should be familiar with this type of pawn sacrifice; Black gives up a pawn, but gains space on the kingside, as well as the e5-square for a knight. Chances are balanced again. } 23. Bf2 { Or  23.Bd4  f3  with a dangerous attack. } 23... f3 24. g3 Ne5 { A precise move order.   Weaker is:  24...Nxg3 ?!  25.Bxg3 !   but not  25.hxg3 ?!  Ne5  26.Nxe5  dxe5  27.Kf1  Bxg3  28.Bxg3  Rxg3  with reasonable compensation for the piece  25...Ne5   but not  25...Bxg3 ?  26.Ne7+  +-  26.Nxe5  dxe5  27.Kf2  White should be winning with precise play, though Black still has some practical chances with  27...Qd8  !?. For example  28.c5 ?   better is  28.Rg1  ±  28...Bxg3+  29.hxg3  Rxg3 !  30.Kxg3  Qg5+ =  forcing a perpetual check, since  31.Kh2 ?   31.Kf2 =  loses to  31...Rf4  with forced mate. } 25. Nxe5 dxe5 { When I reached this position however, I was somewhat optimistic, since I had calculated: } 26. Kf1 { Which is apparently the only move, and the beginning of an interesting idea. I decided to bring the king to a safer place, even at the cost of material, to be able subsequently to push the c- and d-pawns decisively.   Instead, attempting to consolidate the kingside with  26.Bf1 ?  fails to  26...Qd8  27.c5  Nxg3 !  with a decisive attack:  28.hxg3  Bxg3  29.Bxg3  Rxg3+  30.Kf2   or  30.Kh1  f2  with forced checkmate  30...Qh4  White cannot escape. For example:  31.Ke3  f2+ !  32.Ke2  Qg4+  33.Kd2  Qf4+  34.Ke2  Qe3#   Similar is  26.c5 ?  Bxg3 !  27.hxg3  Nxg3  28.Bxg3  Rxg3+  29.Kf1  Qd8 !  followed by  ...Qg5  winning. } 26... Bg5 { Preparing the ...Qd7-h3 invasion.   Of course not  26...Qd7 ?  27.gxh4.   The piece sacrifice  26...Nxg3+ !?  is still possible:  27.hxg3  and now  27...Bxg3   or  27...Rxg3 !?  with unclear position  leads to a draw after the forced line:  28.Bxg3  Rxg3  29.Qh2 !  Rg2  30.Qh3  Qd8 !  31.Rc2  Qg5  32.Rxg2  fxg2+  33.Kg1  Qf4  34.Kxg2  Rf6  Black’s attack could be dangerous, therefore White should choose:  35.Qc8+ !  Kf7  36.Qd7+  Kf8   but not  36...Kg6 ?  37.Rg1 !  +-  37.Rf1  Rg6+  38.Kh1  Rh6+  39.Kg2  Rg6+  A very nice perpetual check. } 27. Ke1 { A prophylactic move, freeing the f1-square in order to reply to 27... Qd7 with 28. Bf1 preventing the deadly invasion on h3.   Instead, the natural  27.Rb1 ?  allows  27...Qc8 !  when the entry on  h3  is decisive, for example:  28.Ke1  Qh3  29.Bg1  f2+ !  Opening the f-file decisively.  30.Bxf2  Rgf6  31.Bg1  Rf1+ !  32.Bxf1  Qxf1# } 27... Qd7 { Or  27...Bxc1  28.Rxc1  is similar to the game. } 28. Bf1 { Necessary and effective, keeping Black’s offensive under control. } 28... Nf6 { If  28...Bxc1  29.Rxc1  Nf6  30.c5  transposes to the note to the next move. } 29. c5 { Black’s initiative has been neutralized, and now the pawns start marching.   Again  29.Rb1 ?  , keeping the exchange, gives Black some initiative after:  29...Ng4 !? } 29... Ng4 { Creating the threats ...Nxh2, ...Ne3 or ...Be3.   If  29...Bxc1  30.Rxc1  White has more than enough compensation for the exchange:  30...Ng4   or  30...Rg4  31.Bd3  31.c6  Qd6  32.Qb3 !  ± Black’s threats have come to a stop, while the passed pawns are very strong. } 30. d6 { One more step toward promotion; the threat is c5-c6-c7 nearly winning. In addition, this move creates the possible check Qb3, protecting the e3-square against ...Be3 or ...Ne3. } 30... bxc5 { Necessary was  30...Nxf2 !  31.Kxf2  Rh6  32.h4  Qg4  with a very unclear position.   The capture  30...Nxh2 ?  is way too slow:  31.c6  Qc8  32.c7  followed by d6-d7 winning.   And of course not:  30...Be3 ?  31.Bxe3  Nxe3  32.Qb3+  Kh8  33.Qxe3  +- } 31. bxc5 Bxc1 { The decisive mistake.   Again, necessary was  31...Nxf2 !  32.Kxf2  Rh6  with an unclear position. } 32. c6 { +- A very important intermediate move, after which White is just winning. } 32... Qc8 { Or:  32...Qd8  33.c7  Qd7  34.Rxc1  +-   If  32...Be3  33.cxd7  Bxf2+  34.Qxf2  Nxf2  35.Bc4+ !  Kh8  36.Kxf2  the endgame is winning with the transfer Bf7-e8. } 33. Qxc1 { White is an exchange down, but the two pawns on the 6th rank decide the game. } 33... Nxf2 { Again there is no time for  33...Nxh2  because of:  34.c7 !  Qd7  35.Ba6  +- } 34. Kxf2 Rh6 35. h3 { Black’s threats are completely neutralized, and the rest of the game is just a tactical exhibition. } 35... Qb8 { An interesting resource during time trouble, searching for counterplay with 36...Qb6.   35...Rxh3 ?  fails to:  36.d7  Rh2+  37.Kg1  Qc7  38.Kxh2  +- } 36. Qc4+ Kh8 37. Qb5 { Blocking the queen’s invasion. } 37... Qc8 38. Qc5 { An X-ray attack against the rook on f8. } 38... Rg8 39. d7 { This rather paradoxical pawn advance decides the game nicely. Typically, one should push pawns onto squares of the opposite colour to one’s bishop, but here we can make an exception for tactical reasons.   39.c7 !?  +- would be more conceptual. } 39... Qc7 40. d8=Q { This is the motive behind the previous move; Black is now unable to prevent the promotion of the c6-pawn. } 40... Rxd8 41. Rxd8+ Qxd8 42. c7 Qc8 43. Qe7 { Threatening Qd8 with checkmate. } 43... Rf6 { If  43...Re6  White has the nice variation  44.Qd8+  Re8  45.Qxe8+ !  Qxe8  46.Ba6  followed by promotion and winning with an extra piece. } 44. Ba6 { A neat final blow. Black resigned since his pieces are overloaded in the defence of the 8th rank:  44...Qg8   or  44...Rxa6  45.Qd8+   or  44...Qxa6  45.Qd8+  45.c8=Q  Final remarks  1. A critical factor during the opening phase was whether Black would be able to exchange pieces, reducing White’s queenside potential. The comments to moves 14 and 15 deserve special attention.  2. Despite some tactical inaccuracies, Black’s kingside potential proved dangerous throughout the game.  3. The reader should remember the typical pawn sacrifice ...e5-e4 followed by ...f5-f4.   4. The most exciting moment in this game is probably when White plays Kf1-e1 giving up the exchange in order to secure his king and continue advancing his central passed pawns. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Judit Polgar – Leinier Dominguez Perez, FIDE World Cup, Khanty-Mansiysk 2011@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game illustrates the difference in quality and potential between White’s bad light-squared bishop, and Black’s ‘bad’ dark-squared bishop. } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5 7. Nf3 Be7 8. Bc4 O-O 9. O-O Qc7 10. Bb3 Be6 11. Qe2 Rc8 12. Rfd1 b5 13. Bg5 Nbd7 14. Rac1 b4 15. Nd5 Bxd5 16. Bxf6 Nxf6 17. exd5 { A very questionable positional decision.   Better was  17.Bxd5  Nxd5  18.Rxd5  Qc4 !?  19.Qxc4  Rxc4  20.Nd2  Rc6  when Black has only a microscopic advantage after  21.c4  !.  The reader should study this position carefully, as it is essential for the understanding of the chapter. As we have studied in the previous games, White’s plan is to accomplish an expansion on the queenside with the usual b2-b4, c2-c4-c5; we know this is not going to happen in this game. Still, it is possible for White to open the queenside with c2-c3, but is this really going to help? The answer is no. There is a bigger factor hiding in the positional background and the reader should learn this once and forever. White’s biggest problem is the qualitative difference between the bishops. Although both bishops are momentarily blocked, only Black’s bishop has active prospects, either on the diagonal a1-h8, or the diagonal g1-a7.    Meanwhile, White’s bishop will be a spectator throughout the entire game. It is not uncommon for players of the white pieces  (even at the top level)  to go into this kind of position without seriously accounting for this problem, and this game is a wonderful illustration of how to convert Black’s positional advantage into a full point. } 17... Qd7 { =+ Covering the a4-square, and so preventing White from improving her bishop with Ba4-c6. } 18. Bc4 Qa7 { The manoeuvre ...Qd7-a7 has prevented White’s bishop from moving to c6. Note that this bishop will not move again  (or do anything)  for the rest of the game.   Another option was  18...Rc5 !?  since  19.Bxa6 ?  Nxd5  ∓ gives Black a big advantage due to his central control. } 19. c3 { If White insists with  19.Bb3  , intending to follow with Ba4-c6, then  19...Rc5  pressures the d5-pawn, preventing the manoeuvre   or  19...Qd7 !?  20.Bc4  Rc5  as explained above. } 19... bxc3 20. Rxc3 Bd8 { Transferring the bishop to b6 where it will exert strong pressure on f2. } 21. Ng5 { Polgar does not like passive defence, and prefers to embark on a questionable attack.    More natural was  21.Rdc1  but Black can slowly improve his position:  21...Rab8  22.R3c2  a5  23.b3  a4  =+   Another option is  21.Nd2  Rab8  22.b3   but not  22.Bxa6 ?  Rxc3  23.bxc3  Nxd5  ∓  22...a5  23.Rdc1  Bb6  24.Rf3  threatening  Rxf6  with counterplay, but after  24...Qe7  White cannot solve her problems. For example:  25.Ne4  Nxe4  26.Qxe4  g6  =+ followed by  ...f7-f5  , and note that the optimistic  27.g4 ?  intending to prevent  ...f7-f5  is refuted by  27...f5 !  since  28.gxf5 ?  loses the rook to  28...Qg5+. } 21... a5 22. Rf3 { The position is not well-suited for kingside operations, and Black easily neutralizes any possible threats. Nevertheless, it is difficult to suggest a better approach.   Trading knights with  22.Ne4  Nxe4  23.Qxe4  is similar to the game:  23...Rab8  24.b3   or  24.Rc2  a4  =+  24...a4  =+   A worthy alternative was  22.a4 !?  preventing Black from playing  ...a5-a4  , though after  22...Bb6  23.Rf3  Qe7  24.b3  g6  =+ Black progresses slowly with  ...Bc5  ,  ...Rab8  and later a kingside expansion with  ...f7-f5  and  ...e5-e4. } 22... Qe7 23. b3 { This move makes it easier for Black to carry out a desirable break.   A better option was  23.Ne4  , though after  23...Nxe4  24.Qxe4  Rab8  25.Qe2  g6  =+ Black enjoys a pleasing positional edge due to his much better bishop and his chances to expand with  ...f7-f5. } 23... a4 { ∓ Logical and very strong, as it opens the a-file for Black’s rook, and forces the creation of a weak b3-pawn. } 24. Rh3 { If  24.bxa4  Rxa4  25.Bb5  Rb4  26.Bc6   or  26.Rb3  Rxb3  27.axb3  e4 !?  ∓  26...h6  27.Nh3  Rcb8  winning because of the invasion down the b-file and the poor coordination of White’s forces. Note how the light-squared bishop is still doing nothing.   If  24.Ba6 ?!  Rc7  25.bxa4  h6 !  26.Nh3   26.Ne4 ??  Nxe4  27.Qxe4  Rxa6  -+  26...Nxd5 !  regaining the pawn with dividends. } 24... g6 25. Qc2 axb3 26. axb3 Bb6 { Even stronger was the concrete  26...e4 !  27.Qe2  Qe5  28.Rg3  Ra1 !  threatening  ...Rxe1  followed by  ...Ra8-a1  29.Rxa1  Qxa1+  30.Qf1  Qe5  (threatening ...Nh5)  31.Qe2  Ra8  when White’s position is hopeless. } 27. Rf1 Ng4 { A logical move, but not the strongest.   Even better was  27...e4 !  threatening  ...e4-e3  with a winning position, for example:  28.Kh1  Ng4 !  29.Nxe4  Rxc4 !!  30.Qxc4  Qxe4  31.Qxe4  Nxf2  +-+ The reader should not be fooled into thinking this is ”just tactics” and Black has been very lucky. All these tactical resources are the result of Black’s strategic superiority, particularly White’s inability to fight for the dark squares. } 28. Ne4 { But not  28.Nxh7 ?  due to  28...Nxf2 !  -+ demolishing White’s defence, e.g.  29.Rxf2 ?!  Ra1+. } 28... f5 29. Rg3 Nf6 { Even stronger was  29...Rf8 !  keeping the knights on the board:  30.Nc3  e4  31.Nd1   31.Nxe4  is met by  31...Qe5 !  threatening ...Ra1  32.Nc3  Nxf2 !  -+  31...Ra1  White is losing, for example:  32.Rc3  Qa7  33.h3  Nxf2 !  34.Nxf2  Ra2  35.Qc1  Bxf2  +-+ } 30. Nxf6+ Qxf6 31. Rd3 Rc7 32. Qc3 Rca7 { This is a good moment to stop and reflect upon the last few moves. Black has achieved the typical expansion ...f7-f5, placed a bishop on the strong f2-a7 diagonal, and opened the a-file, which he is now ready to invade. Meanwhile, White has accomplished absolutely nothing. I am certainly not trying to say that Judit Polgar has been completely outplayed; in fact both players have made some inaccuracies. My point is that the position after move 17 gives Black excellent prospects and very clear plans, while White does not have constructive ideas, and even the very best players would struggle to find something productive to do. } 33. Rd2 Bd4 34. Qd3 Ra1 35. g3 Rxf1+ 36. Kxf1 Bc5 { Preparing ...e5-e4 gaining more space. } 37. Kg2 e4 38. Qe2 Re8 39. f3 { This ugly move is necessary, because of Black’s threat of ...f5-f4-f3.   Waiting with  39.Ra2  loses to  39...f4 !  40.gxf4   40.f3  Qd4  or  40.Kh1  f3  41.Qe1  e3  are both hopeless  40...Qxf4  when White is defenceless. For example:  41.Kh1  Re5  42.Qf1  Rh5  43.Qg2  Rg5  44.Qh3   or  44.Qf1  Qf3+  45.Qg2  Qxg2#  44...Bxf2  45.Ra8+  Kg7  -+ } 39... exf3+ 40. Qxf3 Re3 { Black’s position is practically winning, as only a computer would be precise enough to defend this position in the long run. Even the smallest mistake would cost White the game. } 41. Qf1 { Instead, the natural  41.Qf4 ?  loses to  41...Re1 !  (threatening ...Be3)  42.Ra2  Rg1+ !  43.Kh3  g5  with forced checkmate. } 41... Qe5 { Threatening ...Qe4.   More precise was  41...Qe7 !  42.Qf4  Re1  and now the natural  43.Ra2 ?  loses to  43...Be3 !  44.Qf3  Rg1+  45.Kh3  Qg5  exactly as in the game, while after  43.Qf3  Rg1+  44.Kh3  Qf6 !?  White’s position is nearly lost too; the threat is  ...g6-g5-g4. } 42. Qf4 { The only defence. } 42... Qe7 43. Ra2 Re1 44. b4 { A blunder in an extremely difficult position.   A better defence was  44.Bd3  but after  44...Kg7 !  White is running out of moves. For example, the natural sequence  45.Rc2 ?!  Qf7 !  46.Bc4 ?  loses to  46...Rg1+  47.Kh3  h6 !  followed by  ...g6-g5-g4  checkmating soon.   Or:  44.Bf1  Re4  45.Qf3  Re3  46.Qf4  Rxb3  ∓ } 44... Be3 45. Qf3 { Also hopeless is:  45.Qh4  g5  46.Qh5  Qe4+  47.Kh3   47.Qf3  Rg1+  47...g4+  48.Kh4  Qe7+  49.Qg5+  Qxg5# } 45... Rg1+ 46. Kh3 Qg5 { White resigned due to the threatened ...Qh6+.  Final remarks  1. White’s light-squared bishop was memorably useless in this game. The reader should never forget the tremendous imbalance between the bishops.  2. White’s biggest mistake was 17.exd5. Since Polgar was close to equality after 17.Bxd5 I would dare to assume she did not expect her position to be so bad after this structure transformation. Players of all levels fall into this strategic mistake very often, and it is something to be remembered.  3. The expansion with ...g7-g6, ...f7-f5, ...e5-e4 is standard and a strong plan if carried out with the appropriate preparation. } *

Based on what we have learned in the previous games, the answer is ”Definitely not!” White’s standard plan in this position is to expand his majority on the queenside, but this is unthinkable after queenside castling. Moreover, the bishop on b3 is restricted by its own pawns, basically doing nothing, while Black’s bishop on f6 has a strong potential to press against White’s king, say after the typical pawn sacrifice ...e5-e4 ! Objectively speaking, this position is slightly better for Black, but in practice Black already has a big advantage since White has no real targets to attack. } 16.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Najdorf Type II@@HeaderEnd@@  Just as in the previous chapter, I shall emphasize that this structure is not only typical of the Najdorf but rather many other variations in the Sicilian, such as   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  e5  5.Nb5  d6.  This structure is one of my favourites, as it provides a nice mix of tactical resources and strategic ideas. I grew up playing the English Attack against the Sicilian, and played this pawn structure many times. I enjoyed opposite flank attacks and most of my games took this direction for good or for bad. This chapter will not focus on these attacks. I will admit they are very exciting and complex, but they lack the strategic substance that constitutes the essence of this book. Instead, we will focus on the strategy that hides behind the combinations. In this structure, all strategic plans are in some way connected to the control of the d5-square. As the reader can easily verify on his own, pretty much every successful attack in this position works out because such central control has been achieved. Now, let's examine how each side may fight for the d5-square:  White's plans  1. Place a knight on d5, and have enough pieces to always be able to recapture with a piece rather than a pawn.  2. Advance g2-g4-g5 expelling Black's knight on f6, a defender of the d5-square.  3. Play Bg5xf6 to eliminate the knight defending the d5-square.  4. Play f2-f4-f5 preventing Black from placing his light-squared bishop on e6.  Black's plans  1. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5 and, by doing so, take over the initiative.  2. Press down the c-file, so that White cannot play Nc3-d5 because of a vulnerable pawn on c2.  3. Play ...b7-b5-b4 expelling White's knight from c3 before Nc3-d5 can be played.  Overall, I believe chances are approximately level. If things work out well for White, he will have pleasant control of the d5-square and he will be able to progress slowly, either positionally on the d-file, or tactically with a kingside pawn storm. On the other hand, if Black's strategy succeeds he will be able either to release his position with ...d6-d5, or favourably transfer into a Najdorf structure of Type I.  Variants of this structure  Throughout this chapter, we will consider two other versions of this pawn structure. The first consists of White having a pawn on c4 rather than c2. Roughly speaking, this permanently prevents the ...d6-d5 break, but instead gives Black the possibility to attack with ...b7-b5. The second version of this pawn structure consists of White having his f-pawn on f5 instead of f3. The main difference is that such a pawn provides better chances for a kingside attack, although the e4-pawn becomes more vulnerable.  This chapter is organized around these three variants of the structure. The first two games are examples of the standard structure with the pawns on c2 and f3. The first game illustrates White's control of the d5-square while the second is an initial example of Black's central break with ...d6-d5. The next two games showcase White's c4-pawn. In the first, White gains a dominating position from the start and easily imposes his advantage, while the second is a complicated game in which Black gains enduring counterplay by breaking White's central hold with ...b7-b5. The last two games illustrate the structure with White's pawn on f5. In the first White successfully prevents the ...d6-d5 break and slowly grinds Black down, while in the second Black does manage to break in the centre with ...d6-d5 and obtains a quick and easy win. } 1. -- *

It is often said that if White controls the d5-square and Black’s only minor piece is the dark-squared bishop, then White should be positionally winning. This statement strongly depends on how far away White’s knight is located. For example, after 18.Rd5 Black had two convincing ways to at least maintain equality since White’s knight was on e1, very far away from the d5-square.  2. Despite the objective balance, starting on move 22 the game became easier for White to play, thus giving him a practical edge. } *

This game is an example of how White can gain a steady control of the d5-square after c2-c4 is played.  2. White goes on to dominate the board, and this game shows how to convert such an advantage into a full point. } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nd7 4. d4 cxd4 5. Qxd4 a6 6. Bxd7+ Bxd7 7. c4 e5 8.

Hence Black should find very concrete counterplay in order to avoid a passive position. } 8... h6 { This is a logical move; Black wants to develop his knight without having to worry about the positional threat of Bg5xf6, but this is just too slow and this move has disappeared from top play.

A possible threat is Ne1-c2-e3-d5. } 14. Ba3 Rd7 15. Nd2 { Taking the route Nd2-f1-e3-d5.   An alternative route was  15.Ne1 !?  followed by Nc2-e3-d5. } 15... O-O 16.

This will be followed by Kd3-c3, b3-b4-b5, etc. White’s queenside pawns have much more winning potential than the h5-pawn, thus it makes sense to play on this flank. } 39... Bf8 40. Bxh6 Bxh6 41.

Later he worsened his position with the weakening  (or at least useless)  11...b6.   2. Around move 16 Black should have played ...Nh5 in order to attempt ...f7-f5 or ...Bg5 to create reasonable counterplay. Instead, trading knights on d5 eliminated his chances to create any serious threats later in the game.  3. The moves 19...Bxd5 and 20...Qa8 only crystallized White’s advantage by reducing the fight down to just the protagonists of the positional imbalance. Black’s weak d6-pawn, and the qualitative difference between White’s active bishop on a3 and Black’s passive bishop on e7, reduced Black’s chances to a minimum. White won the endgame convincingly, as there was little Black could do to hold it. } *

The b-file is open for Black to create counterplay.  2. If White places a knight on d5, Black will capture ...Nxd5  (or ...Bxd5)  forcing White to occupy the d5-square with a pawn. That means White does not have full control of the d5-square. At the moment White cannot proceed with Nf1-e3-d5 since the b3-pawn is hanging.  3. White cannot easily expand on the queenside, since Black is ready to play ...a6-a5 covering the b4-square. } 16.

Nc3 Nc5 30. Bxc5 Qxc5 { The reader should notice how small a role the d5-square has played throughout the game.

It creates an open file for counterplay. Later, playing ...a6-a5 was essential to prevent a queenside expansion, and to keep the b3-pawn vulnerable.  2. White did get full control of the d5-square after all, but it did not matter much because his dark squares were too weak, which gave Black enough counterplay.  3. The key to Black’s success was his ideal piece arrangement. Black’s bishop was quite useful on the g5-square, and the knight transfer ...Nf8-e6-d4 was always a strong idea. Black had so many resources for counterplay that White’s control of the d5-square made little impact and did not prevent the creation of multiple threats.  4. Overall, Black’s play was a model for how to conduct this type of position, and to prove that Black has sufficient resources for counterplay provided he opens some lines and keeps his pieces active. } *

This game is an illustration of White’s many resources once the f4-f5 advance has been achieved.  2. This game has two very marked phases, which could even be studied independently:  A  Between the beginning of the middlegame and up to move 27, this example illustrates how powerful White’s attacking chances are when associated with a g4-g5 break. This attack has a strong positional foundation, because White not only attacks on the kingside, but also gains a better control of d5, as Black’s f6 knight is driven away.  B  The second phase of the game starts from Black’s 27th move, which is the transition to an endgame. The rest of the analysis is devoted to explaining White’s winning plans and Black’s best defensive resources. } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8.

His pieces are well organized and there exist both strategic and dynamic elements in his favour. The kingside attack based on h2-h4 followed by g4-g5 is much faster than Black’s counterplay on the queenside. In addition, Black’s pieces are not well prepared to fight for the control of the key d5-square, in particular note how ineffective the bishop is on d7.

Black is in serious trouble after  15.h4 !  preparing g4-g5 followed by Nc3-d5, gaining great attacking chances. Black does not have a satisfactory reply. For example  15...Nb4  threatening  16...Nxa2  , is simply answered by  16.Rh2  protecting  c2  , possibly followed by a2-a3 and g4-g5; then  16...a5  17.a3  a4  18.Na1  Nc6  19.g5  Ng8  20.Nd5  +- when Black’s position is lost both tactically and strategically. } 15...

Now this recapture is a nice  (and standard)  choice, opening the c-file for White while maintaining control of the key d5-square. In fact, Black will generally avoid taking on  b3  , because of this recapture, but in this case the standard  18...b5 !  is better than usual, as it prevents the light-squared bishop from becoming active and, of course, it threatens  ...b5-b4  disputing the d5-square:  19.Rc1  Qb7  20.b4  += Black’s position is worse, but remains playable due to his potential activity on the queenside; for example, after a typical  ...a6-a5  break, followed by  ...b5-b4.

Qf3 { This imprecision is hard to understand from such a strong player. Fortunately for us, Almasi’s mistake gives us the gift of a very interesting endgame to study.   Better was  25.Nxf6+  gxf6   or  25...Bxf6  26.Qd2  Be7  27.g5  ±  26.Qd2  ± followed by  Bd5  ,  Rc1  and c2-c3 opening the queenside advantageously, since Black’s king does not have a safe place to hide. } 25...

Over the last several moves White has disregarded many good tactical opportunities in order to reach a superior endgame. Is this approach correct? In my opinion it is not. The resulting endgame, although superior for White, offers Black good chances to survive, as we will analyze. } 31. Rd5 { The best option.   Instead  31.Qxc4 ?  Rxc4  32.Rd5  Kd7  leaves White in a position that, although preferable, contains few winning chances since a queenside expansion is impossible. } 31... Kd7 { This move gives White an extra opportunity to keep queens on the board.    The correct reaction was:  31...Qxb3 !  32.axb3  Rc6  33.Red1  Threatening  Be1xb4.    33...h5 !   Another option was  33...O-O  34.Be1  Rb8  with reasonable chances to hold the game.   Black would like to react with  33...Kd7  34.Be1  Rb8   but  33...Kd7  is refuted by  34.Rxe5.  34.g5  f6  35.g6   Or  35.gxf6  gxf6  36.Rg1  Kf7  37.Be1  Rb8  with good chances to hold the endgame.  35...Kd7  This is the point! The e5-pawn is now immune.  36.Ra5  Rhc8  37.Rd2  Bd8  Black should have no problems drawing this endgame. } 32.

Ra8 { Losing control of the c-file, and allowing the key c2-c3 advance.   Instead  33...Rc6  34.Ra4  Rb8  makes it difficult for White to progress as c2-c3 is both necessary and very difficult to carry out:  35.Rd1  Bd8  36.Rd5  a5  when there is no trace of White’s once huge advantage. } 34. Rd1 Kc6 35. c3 bxc3 36. bxc3 { White is getting back on track for winning the game. He will now expand with b3-b4 and c3-c4, increasing his dominance and gaining the potential breaks b4-b5 and c4-c5. The following moves are rather schematic, and many different orders would have lead to pretty much the same outcome. } 36... Kb7 37. Ra4 Rhc8 { Trying to create counterplay is not simple. For example:  37...Rhg8  (with the idea ...g7-g6)  38.c4  Kc6  Protecting the d6-pawn   or  38...g6  39.f6 !  Bxf6  40.Rxd6  .  39.b4  g6  40.Rxa6+ !

Rd5 Kc6 42. b4 Bc7 43. c4 { This is probably the kind of position Almasi was aiming for when he decided to decline his tactical opportunities earlier in the game. White’s chances are very promising due to the weak pawns on a6 and d6. } 43... Rcb8 { Slightly better was:  43...g6  44.f6   but not  44.fxg6 ?!  fxg6  as Black gains some chances of counterplay along the f-file  44...g5  45.h5  Re8  Followed by  ...Re6  , similar to the game, but with some extra moves for Black. } 44. Kc3 Kb7 45. Rd1 { Better was:  45.Be3 !  (aimed at preventing Black’s only active plan with ...g7-g6)  45...Rg8  46.h5 !

For example  46...f6   weak is  46...g6 ?  47.hxg6  fxg6  48.Bxh6  winning a pawn  47.Ra1  Rgd8  48.Rad1  Rac8  when White can prepare a potential c4-c5 or b4-b5 break, which should be enough to win. Play could then proceed  49.Kb3  Rb8  50.c5 !?  Kc6  51.Kc4  when Black cannot take on c5:  51...dxc5 ?  52.Bxc5  +- And White will trade rooks followed by  Bf8. } 45... Rg8 46. Be3 { Too slow.   Better was  46.h5 !?  as in the previous note. } 46... g6 { A good decision.   Instead  46...Kc6  47.Rda1  Kb7  48.b5  lands Black in serious trouble. } 47. f6 { But not  47.Bxh6 ?  due to  47...gxf5  48.gxf5  Rg4  regaining the pawn with active play. } 47... g5 { Preventing g4-g5. Now the f6-pawn will be a weakness, distracting White’s forces from queenside operations. } 48. h5 { Worse is  48.hxg5  hxg5  when Black will bring his pieces into the game via the h-file. } 48... Rgc8 { Somewhat better was  48...Rge8  49.Rf1  Re6  when White is tied to the defence of the f6-pawn, and it is unclear how to play for a win anymore. } 49. Rda1 Re8 50. R4a2 Bb6 { A very unfortunate mistake, just when Black’s accurate defence was beginning to give results.   Instead  50...Re6  would have given decent chances to save the game.

Kc7 58. c5 { Black resigns, since after  58...dxc5+  59.Kxc5  Kb7  60.Rxa6  the kingside pawns will be lost.  Final remarks  1. Having a pawn on f5 together with a firm control of the d5-square gives White superb attacking chances. The attack is enhanced by having a bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal.  2. White’s play was strong, but careless through the first phase. He missed multiple near-winning options in order to transfer the game into a superior, but possibly defensible, endgame.  3. The endgame was practically very difficult for Black. In fact, Black executed all the correct ideas, but lost due to a simple miscalculation with 50...Bb6. Without this mistake, Black could have held the game for much longer, and possibly even drawn after a long and precise defence. Again, it is not easy to deal with a weak d5-square, and Black could have committed a decisive mistake later on.  4. Black faced problems due to the weak d5-square throughout the game. In order to improve upon his chances it would be necessary to correct the opening imprecisions, especially 14...e5 which converts the game into a Najdorf Type II structure where Black is not ready to fight for the d5-square. } *
