Then the question is: Why does this happen? The reason is that in most variations, the weakness of the d6- and b7-pawns is far more important than losing the b2-pawn, and the well-advanced d5-pawn turns the balance in White’s favour in most cases.

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Type I@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure most commonly appears in the King's Indian, the Queen's Indian and the Ruy Lopez. In my own games, I often encountered this structure with Black, and I lost many games without really understanding why. For this reason, when writing this book I considered this structure to be one of my main interests and I decided it deserves a separate chapter from other King's Indian positions, as the character of the game is somewhat different.   The difference between this structure and those in the following two chapters is the open c-file. This file plays a major role and Black's ability to stay in the game will depend on whether he knows what to do with it. The questions are:  A  Should Black proceed with a kingside attack regardless of the open c-file?  B  Should he fight for the control of this file?  The problem with Strategy A is that White's forces may penetrate down the c-file, distracting Black from a kingside attack. For example, if White were to place a rook on the seventh rank, it would be difficult for Black's kingside play to continue making progress.  The problem with Strategy B is that White's spatial advantage often guarantees control of the c-file in the long run. White has more space thanks to his central chain e4-d5. If the position is not too simplified then this space translates into being able to manoeuvre more easily. In such cases, although Black may control the c-file at an early stage, it will be White who will ultimately profit from it, or from queenside play in general. This is not to say Black's queenside attempts are always doomed, but the reader should understand that Black's spatial disadvantage and White's lack of weaknesses will make it difficult for Black to gain an advantage from queenside play alone.  Despite these difficulties, I believe approaches A and B are both valid given the right circumstances. Ideally, they could even be combined, though this is hard to accomplish in practice. Now, let's discuss specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. If Black controls the c-file, the main task is to cover Black's entry points  (especially c2)  , and then manoeuvre to fight for the control of this file.  2. If White possesses the c-file, then prepare a seventh-rank invasion which is likely to capture the b7-pawn.  3. Expand on the queenside with a2-a4-a5 to gain space, limit Black's mobility and create potentially strong passed pawns once Black's queenside pawns are captured.  4. If Black plays ...b7-b5, then break with a2-a4, and even the manoeuvre Nb4-c6 deserves consideration.  Black's plans  1. If entry points are available, or if White's c-file is vulnerable, then double rooks on the c-file, and possibly invade the seventh rank by placing a rook on c2. This is ideal, but hard to achieve.  2. Create kingside counterplay with ...f7-f5xe4 to open the f-file. This can be followed by ...Bg7-f6-g5 to create kingside threats, and possibly ...h7-h5-h4-h3.  3. If White's play is particularly slow, then ...f7-f5, followed by ...f5-f4 and ...g6-g5-g4 might work.  4. Transfer the dark-squared bishop from g7 to b6 via f6-d8.  The reader should pay close attention to Black's Plans 2 and 3. As stated above, White can easily create diversions on the c-file, preventing Black from focusing on the kingside. This means Black's kingside play should give priority to speed. For this reason, the typical plan ...f7-f5-f4 followed by ...g6-g5-g4 could be too slow, and Black's Plan 2 is more likely to yield results. Black's Plan 3 would only work well if White's queenside play was really slow.  Examples 1 and 2 of this chapter will illustrate how White gains control of the queenside  (and the c-file)  despite Black's seemingly being in control at an earlier stage. Then, Example 3 illustrates White's excellent winning chances in the endgame. The reader should notice the similarity between this endgame and those endgames studied in Chapter 11. After Example 3 a fragment of a game illustrates Black's dream position in this structure, and later we see two more realistic examples of Black's play. The first of these showcases Black's kingside counterplay with ...f7-f5 while the second illustrates Black's queenside opportunities once some pieces come off the board. We also see Black's Plan 4 put in practice to yield excellent results. } 1. -- *

The reader should examine this position very carefully and try to make an assessment of it. After analyzing this game, I would advise the reader to contrast his initial opinion and his final opinion. I imagine it might be quite different. In his analysis of this game, McShane wonders if going into this position   with  21...Nxb5  was the right decision. His original evaluation indicated that he would have sufficient counterplay with his rooks on the c-file, but as he points out, there are no entry points. This is a phenomenon which I have observed far too many times in my own experience, and in those games I have analyzed. Black’s position is reasonably good in appearance, but the truth is that it is very difficult to find counterplay, and although it is Black who is temporarily in control of the only open file, only White can really benefit from queenside play, as we will see in this game. } 23. f3 { += A simple move that should be remembered. It provides extra support to the chain e4-d5, and it allows the bishop to come back to f2 in order to press against Black’s queenside.   As McShane points out,  23.a4 ?  is a serious imprecision, since after  23...g5  24.Bg3  f5  White is forced to destroy his ”glorious” e4-d5 chain with  25.exf5   but not  25.f3 ?  f4  25...Nxf5.  Now the d5-pawn has been weakened, while the bishop on  g3  is temporarily useless. A possible continuation is  26.Rc1  Rxc1  27.Qxc1  Rc8  28.Qd2  Rc5  with level chances. } 23... Rac8 24. Bd3 { Something to note is how White can improve slowly, while Black can’t. The move 24.Bd3 clears e2 for the queen, prepares against ...f6-f5, and gives extra protection to the c2-square. Meanwhile, Black controls the c-file, but cannot do much with it.   Less accurate is  24.Bf2  since Black immediately gains counterplay with  24...f5  !. A possible continuation is  25.Bd3  fxe4  26.fxe4  Bf6  27.a4  Bg5  and Black is closer to equality than in the game. } 24... Qf8 { There is nothing better than spending a tempo to prepare ...f6-f5. White was planning to follow with a3-a4, Qe2, Nc4 and only then bring his bishop back to f2.  Black cannot afford to wait with his queen on e7, as ...f6-f5 is his only constructive plan.   Attempting to ”use” the c-file with  24...Rc3  does not really go anywhere after  25.a4  when White can continue with his plans, ignoring the rook on  c3   but not  25.Rb3 ?!  since trading pieces alleviates Black’s space problems  and Black cannot insist with  25...Ra3 ?  since the rook gets trapped after:  26.Nc4  Rc3   or  26...Ra2  27.Qb3  +-  27.Rb4  +- Followed by  Qd2. } 25.

Although Black controlled the c-file, he was unable to use it. White was able to gradually gain control of the queenside thanks to his spatial advantage.  3. Since Black had nothing to gain on the queenside, all attention should be directed to kingside play. The break ...f6-f5 was absolutely necessary, and unlike many other King’s Indian positions, advancing ...f5-f4 was not always a good idea. In fact, on moves 26-29 it would have been a poor decision since this would slow down the creation of kingside threats, while White can create a strong queenside attack very quickly. In general, White’s queenside play can distract Black’s forces rather easily once the c-file is open. } *

Moreover, Black’s dark-squared bishop  (the bad bishop)  has already been traded so he should have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately for Black, reality is not so simple. The biggest problem is that, as in the previous game, White has a significant space advantage due to the favourable e4-d5 vs e5-d6 chain.

Wojtaszek was able to see into the future of the game and realize that the c-file would ultimately belong to White, while Black would not be able to gain any counterplay.  2. A key move for White was 22.Bh3, preventing Black’s counterplay with ...f7-f5. After this move Black falls into a passive and rather desperate position.  3. The reader should see a close similarity between this position and the games Polugaevsky – Ivkov and Smeets – Tiviakov from Chapter 11, in which White inevitably gains control of the c-file due to his spatial advantage. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@How should Black play?@@HeaderEnd@@  White’s previous three wins were very convincing, and the reader may wonder how Black is supposed to play. I want to answer this question by first showing a short fragment from the game Bouaziz – Beliavsky, Szirak 1987.  After a Ruy Lopez opening, the game reached the position in the diagram, and now Black turned into the structure we are studying with: } 1... cxd5 2. cxd5 { And now: } 2... Ng6 { This is a good move for two reasons. Black will improve his least-useful piece by playing ...Be7-d8-b6 while the knight on g6 is ready to jump to f4. Note how difficult it is for White to cover all the knight jumps when Black’s knights are on f6 and g6; it seems like Black always has something useful to do.   A different continuation, such as  18...bxa4  19.bxa4  Rb8  20.Qe2  a5  21.Ne3  Ng6  22.g3  Rec8  23.Bd2  +=, gives White a dominating position after  Bd3  and  Nc4.

It should be noted that, unlike the previous three examples, Black transferred into this pawn structure under good conditions.  2. The conditions were good because there was time for the plan ...Be7-d8-b6 to be executed, and because Black’s knights were well placed on f6 and g6. In addition, White was not in time to claim queenside space with a2-a4-a5.  The following two games are more recent and much more realistic executions of Black’s plans. } *

This game illustrates Black’s effective queenside play once the position is somewhat simplified.  2. Later in the game we see the battle between White’s light-squared bishop and Black’s dark-squared bishop, where Black executes the strong ...Bf6-d8-b6 manoeuvre and manages to win convincingly. } 1. e4 c5 2.

Ba4+ Ke7 { We have reached a very interesting position, corresponding to the Najdorf Type II. As the reader may recall, one of the key issues in that structure is the control of the d5-square, thus we know White must be doing okay at the very least. However, comparing this position with the game Tiviakov – Anand from that chapter, we see a crucial difference: White has the wrong bishop. Typically, the light-squared bishop can be very effective on b3 if the c-pawn is still on c2; as an example, take the game Almasi – Aagaard from that chapter. In the present case though, the light-squared bishop has few prospects as it is blocked by the c4-pawn, which means Black is doing fine. } 17. Nd5+ { This is a very unfortunate positional decision; the kind of mistake I hope you will not make after reading this book. White chooses a very bad occasion to go into the structure studied in this chapter.   Playing this position in the spirit of a Najdorf Type II yields only equality, for example:  17.Bc2  Rhc8  18.Bd3  Kf8  19.Nd2  h5  20.Nf1  Bh6  with level chances.   But instead, White could have prepared  Nd5  , hoping to obtain this chapter’s structure under favourable circumstances. I believe the strongest move was:  17.Rac1  Rac8  18.Rc2   18.Nd5+ ?  is premature due to:  18...Nxd5  19.cxd5 ?  Qxc1  ∓  18...Rhd8 ?

The reader should ask: what is the difference between this position and Wojtaszek – Swiercz? Black is not well prepared to pursue counterplay with ...f7-f5, but under these conditions he does not even have to. The main point is that there are only two minor pieces on the board, and in particular White is missing his typically strong dark-squared bishop. Black’s pieces have sufficient space to manoeuvre, thus the position is roughly equal, or even slightly preferable for Black due to the awkward location of White’s light-squared bishop. } 18... b5 { Another alternative was  18...Rhc8 !?  securing control of the c-file.

The resemblance between this game and Polgar – Dominguez from Chapter 8 is astonishing, and the reader is encouraged to revisit that game. This similarity only reinforces how similar pawn structures have similar plans and strategic elements.  2. White was unable to gradually increase his queenside predominance  (as often occurs in this structure)  because two minor pieces were already off the board on move 18, and because his light-squared bishop was of little use.  3. Black’s most essential move was 28...Bf6, bringing the bishop into the game via d8-b6. This thematic manoeuvre is something to remember, as the bishop became much stronger than White’s bishop on c6. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Type II@@HeaderEnd@@  The structure studied in this chapter often arises from King's Indian and Benoni variations. It is a common variant of the most typical King's Indian structure, which is studied in the next chapter, where Black has a pawn on c7 rather than c5. By having his pawn on c5, Black is able to slow down White's queenside play, giving Black chances for a checkmating attack in standard King's Indian style. Nevertheless, White has a significant spatial advantage and may attempt active play on both flanks, which is generally enough to guarantee a small advantage.  Unlike other structures studied in this book, the tightly closed nature of this structure provides both sides with multiple ways to carry out their plans. There exist so many possibilities that analyzing a position thoroughly is a rather complex task, even with the help of an engine. In addition, many games will result in opposite-flank attacks, which are difficult to evaluate as they combine many tactical and strategic elements. Finally, I believe most of today's engines are poorly prepared to evaluate these kinds of closed positions properly, as the engines are not fully capable of foreseeing the many positional sacrifices Black may make in an attack.  As a general statement, I believe White is slightly better in most of these positions, but the resulting games are so flexible and complicated that Black always stands a chance. On the plus side, this structure's complexity is ideal for those players who absolutely need to play for a win as Black. Now let's outline specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. Create queenside tension with b2-b4, and later invade down the b-file.  2. Create central tension with the f2-f4 break, and later obtain a kingside attack, or pressure against the potentially weak d6-pawn.  3. Block the kingside with g2-g4, and then proceed with a queenside attack.  4. Trade light-squared bishops if possible, as it often reduces the strength of Black's kingside attack.  5. If possible, respond to Black's ...f7-f5 break with Ng5-e6 and make use of this outpost. This is a good idea, though Black players will rarely allow it.  Black's plans  1. Create a kingside attack by means of ...f7-f5-f4 and then ...g6-g5-g4.  2. Gain kingside activity with ...f7-f5xe4 opening the f-file. This plan is faster than Plan 1, but not as strong.  3. Advance ...h7-h5-h4, and possibly activate the fianchettoed bishop through the h6-c1 diagonal.  4. Play on the queenside with ...b7-b5, though this is far less likely as White is going to play b2-b4 and the resulting tension is usually favourable to White due to his spatial advantage.  White's Plan 1 is probably the most common, while Black's Plan 4 is pretty rare, since White has more space on the queenside and is likely to dominate this side of the board. Choosing between Black's Plans l and 2  (...f5-f4 or ...f5xe4)  depends on how far advanced White is on the queenside. Similarly to the previous chapter, if White is already creating threats, then playing ...f5-f4 and attempting ...g6-g5-g4 will be far too slow to help. In contrast, if Black has managed to neutralize White's queenside play, then Black's Plan 1 is certainly the most ambitious and advisable continuation.  Black will play ...f7-f5 in essentially every game in this structure, which means White will probably have an option to play exf5  (or in some cases be forced to make this capture)  . This capture on f5 modifies the structure significantly, and Black may recapture this pawn with the g-pawn or with a piece. The first two examples of this chapter will consider Black's recapture ...gxf5, while the third example will briefly explain what happens when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece.  The following chapter will have four additional examples of these positions, with the only difference of having a pawn on c7 rather than c5, which does not modify the character of the game so much.  After the third example the remainder of the chapter will be devoted to the study of White's plans. One example will examine White's queenside play with b2-b4, while the other will illustrate how White may carry out the f2-f4 central break successfully. White's Plan 3  (g2-g4)  is worthy of attention, but will not be included in this chapter, as a similar version of it is studied in Chapter 16. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation A@@HeaderEnd@@  Conceptually speaking, recapturing on f5 with a pawn seems to be the healthier option, keeping control of the e4-square and opening the g-file for the potential kingside attack which Black may develop.   White will often advance his f-pawn to either f3 or f4, giving rise to different types of games. The following two games will exemplify each case. White wins in the first example by playing f2-f4, and loses in the second case when playing f2-f3, but this does not mean one reaction is correct while the other is erroneous. The reader should pay close attention to why a player may choose f2-f4 over f2-f3 and vice versa. In addition, he should observe which manoeuvres give advantage to each side for each of these structures. } 1. -- *

Final remarks  1. White’s biggest mistake was wasting time with moves 17, 21, 22 and 23, to then get his own queen stuck out of the game. The problem was White’s lack of targets on the queenside.  2. After 26.exf5 gxf5 Black is essentially winning, but not because of the structure. Black is winning because White cannot prevent the knight transfer ...Nh5-f4, and because the queen is still completely sidelined on a4. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation B@@HeaderEnd@@  When Black recaptures on f5 with a piece, the resulting structure gives a natural outpost for White on e4. In fact, White's main plan in this position will be to establish firm control of the e4-square, preferably by occupying it with a knight. With a white knight on e4, Black's d6-pawn will be weak, and later White can proceed with the b2-b4 break which will often allow him to secure a small advantage.  Black is nor without counterplay, and he may find many active continuations based on a kingside attack. Black's potential plans could be:  1. Place knights on f4 and especially d4, to create tactical threats.  2. Play ...g6-g5-g4 to pressure White's f-pawn  (which will probably be on f3)  and then open lines for attack.  3. Fight for the control of the e4-square by placing a bishop on f5 and a knight on f6.  It is very important for Black to maintain good control of his light squares. For this reason, he should try to avoid trading light-squared bishops, as White's control of the e4-square would be far easier and Black's kingside counterplay would be less likely to work. In this chapter we see one example to illustrate this point, though in the next chapter we will see another example of a similar structure  (Rener - Giri)  , in which Black's attack is well executed. } 1. -- *

White took advantage of the b6-square when playing 13.Qb3, to threaten 14.bxc5 Nxc5 15.Qb6.   3. Later, Black had to double rooks on the b-file precisely because the b6-square was weak, otherwise there would have been no entry points and Black’s rooks could have stayed on the a- and f-files doing their jobs.  4. White’s most remarkable move was 32.g3, bringing the light-squared bishop onto a powerful diagonal. This move however, only worked well because Black’s forces were far from the kingside.  5. White’s position after move 36 displays an ideal arrangement of his forces, and in fact Black’s position is already desperate despite having a closed position and equal material. The rest is a matter of technique, and the sample variation offered is just an illustration of White’s many winning methods. } *

During this chapter we have learned about the solidity of Black’s position, and the reader might be tempted to think this is always the case, but here we have a clear counterexample. Unlike previous games, Black’s bishop is located on e7 instead of the desirable g7, and White’s pieces are well arranged for the break f2-f4.

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Type III@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure most commonly occurs in the King's Indian Defence, though it also arises from certain lines within the Bogo-Indian, such as:   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  Bb4+  4.Bd2  Qe7  5.Nf3  Nc6  6.Nc3  Bxc3  7.Bxc3  d6  8.Bg2  e5  9.d5  Nb8  Something to notice about this position is how Black has already got rid of his dark-squared bishop, which is sometimes trapped within the pawn chain, thus this approach for reaching the King's Indian Type III structure deserves consideration. Nevertheless, throughout this chapter we will showcase only examples in which Black possesses his dark-squared bishop, although many of the ideas transfer without much alteration to the case where Black does not have this bishop. This structure typically yields play on opposite Ranks in the style of a 'chain-battle'. White will hit near the base of Black's chain  (the d6-pawn)  with c4-c5, while Black will attack near the base of White's chain  (the e4-pawn)  with ...f7-f5. White's attack is founded on gaining material on the queenside, while Black's aim will be to create a mating attack against White's king, which will often castle short in this structure.  White's plans  1. Break on the queenside with c4-c5xd6 and later invade down the c-file.  2. Expand on the queenside with c4-c5-c6, and if Black replies with ...b7-b6, then invade down the a-file after a2-a4-a5xb6.  3. First block the kingside with g2-g4, and only then proceed with the above queenside plans.  4. If Black allows it, respond to ...f7-f5 with Ng5-e6; although similar to the previous chapter, Black is unlikely to allow White to do this under favourable conditions.  5. Trade light-squared bishops so as to reduce Black's attacking potential.  Black's plans  1. Create a kingside attack with ...f7-f5-f4 and later ...g6-g5-g4-g3, or ...gxf3 attacking the f3-pawn, which becomes the new base of the chain.  2. Obtain counterplay with ...f7-f5xe4 followed by action down the f-file and/or attacking the base of the chain  (the e4-pawn)  .  3. In some cases, play ...h7-h5-h4 and even ...Bg7-h6 to make use of the otherwise trapped bishop on g7.  4. Play ...c7-c6 to create central tension and possibly transpose into a King's Indian Type I structure.  5. Play ...c7-c5 to slow down White's queenside play and transpose into a King's Indian Type II structure.  White's Plans 1 and 2 are by far the most common, while Black's Plan 1 is certainly the most common reply, although in many variations Black will choose any of the remaining four plans he has. Black's Plan 3 is particularly common in the Petrosian variation, and we will see an example of this. Similarly to the previous chapter, White always has the option to reply to ...f7-f5 with exf5, transforming the structure, when Black may either recapture on f5 with a piece or a pawn. These structure transformations are mentioned separately at the beginning of the chapter.  The first four examples in this chapter are devoted to the structure transformation after White captures exf5. The first two are about Black's ...gxf5 reply while the remaining two consider the case when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece. Then we briefly discuss how pieces are typically arranged once Black has played ...f5-f4, after which we study one example of Black's Plan 1.  Note that Black's light-squared bishop plays a major role, both protecting light squares and helping in the attack. In fact, the subsequent example in this chapter  (Azarov - Volke)  shows how Black's attack loses its strength once the light-squared bishops are off the board. The remaining two games examine White's Plan 3. The first of these is a successful implementation, while the second is a great example of how Black should react. Essentially all the plans mentioned above are present in these examples, either within the game itself or within the analysis. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation A@@HeaderEnd@@  Similarly to the previous chapter, the recapture ...gxf5 seems healthier, keeping control of the e4-square and opening the g-file for a kingside attack. A disadvantage of this recapture is that Black's kingside could become vulnerable, as we will see in the next example.   Also in similar style to the previous chapter, White will often advance his f-pawn to either f3 or f4, giving rise to different types of games. The games will develop similarly to those games from the previous chapter, namely Piorun - Hillarp Persson in which White played f2-f3, and Wojtaszek - Fedorov in which White played f2-f4. This time around White will get a good position from playing f2-f3 in the first example, and a bad position from playing f2-f4 in the second case - the exact opposite to the previous chapter. The reader should not attempt to draw general conclusions about whether f2-f3 or f2-f4 is always the best reply. Instead, he should observe how the arrangement of pieces and the circumstances of each game determine which continuation is best. } 1. -- *

If either bishop was missing, this set-up would be far less effective. For example, in the game Piorun – Hillarp Persson from the previous chapter, White’s bishop was not on e3, therefore, he could not prevent the knight transfer to f4.  2. White’s g2-g4 break requires precise calculation but is not quite as uncommon as it might seem. It works well together with a bishop on c2. } *

As we may recall from the game Wojtaszek – Fedorov from the previous chapter, White’s kingside break g3-g4 was very strong, and not having such a plan in this position is already disappointing.  2. Black’s key move was 21...Nc5, bringing the knight into the game, heading towards g3, before closing the central structure with ...e5-e4.   3. White’s imprecise play allowed Black to gain crucial tempos on moves 26-30, helping Black achieve his dream position.  4. Once Black installed his knight on g3 and doubled rooks on the a-file, there was essentially nothing White could hope for, and the sample variation I chose to finish off this game illustrates that. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation B@@HeaderEnd@@  As in the previous chapter, when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece, White obtains an outpost on e4. White's main plan in this position will be to place a well-supported knight on e4 and later break on the queenside with   c4-c5 securing an advantage.  Black's counterplay will be based on kingside action; among his potential plans are the following:  1. Place a knight on f4  (or maybe d4)  , to create tactical threats.  2. Play ...g6-g5-g4 to pressure White's f-pawn  (which is likely to be on f3)  and then open lines for attack.  3. Fight for control of the e4-square by placing a bishop on f5 and a knight on f6.  As we learned in the previous chapter, in the example Mareco - Bachmann, White's position is much the more favourable if light-squared bishops are off the board, because it is easier to control the e4-square, and because Black's dark-squared bishop can turn into a terribly bad bishop, as it did in that game. In this chapter we will repeat this idea, which remains valid. } 1. -- *

Nxe4 Nf5 { We have reached the position of interest and so far both players have followed theory closely, but now White deviates with: } 13. Rc1 { This supports c4-c5 in order to gain queenside play. The position is typical, though not very deeply explored by theory, and it is a good moment to assess the situation. As we know, White desires to obtain firm control of the e4-square, and he will accomplish this after 14.f3 and 15.Ndf2. Hence, it makes sense for Black to begin fighting for the e4-square immediately.   White was more likely to secure a tiny advantage after  13.f3  Nf6  14.Ndf2  Nd4  15.Bd3  with good control of the e4-square. For example,  15...Nh5  16.Re1  Nf4  17.Bf1  += when White’s kingside remains solid and he may proceed with  18.Bc3  to expel the knight from  d4. } 13... Nf6 { Getting ahead of White’s consolidating moves f2-f3 and Ndf2.   An alternative was  13...b6 !?  preventing c4-c5, and if White insists with  14.b4 ?!  then  14...Nf6  15.Bg5  a5 !?  16.a3  axb4  17.axb4  Nd4  =+ when it is pretty clear that White’s c4-c5 break will not yield much. } 14.

He may follow up with  ...g6-g5-g4  and possibly  ...Bh6  afterwards, trading his ‘bad’ bishop.   Also  14.f3  Nxe4  15.fxe4  Nd4  yields an approximately level position after:  16.Rxf8+  Bxf8  17.Be3  Qh4  18.Nf2  Bd7 !? } 14... h6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 { White retains his control of e4 at the cost of giving up his dark-squared bishop, hence becoming vulnerable on the dark squares. } 16. Bg4 b6 { Preventing c4-c5.   White was probably hoping for  16...Nd4  17.Bxc8  Qxc8  trading Black’s valuable light-squared bishop, and now  18.c5  += secures a small advantage for White due to the creation of a weakness on  d6. } 17. Rc3 { This is not exactly a mistake, but it is certainly the beginning of an unnatural plan.   The alternative was  17.Qd2  a5  18.f3  Bg7  when Black has good counterplay associated with  ...h6-h5  and  ...Bh6  , but White may attempt a slow expansion with  19.b3 !?  following up with a2-a3 and b3-b4   or  19.Ndf2  h5  20.Bxf5  Bxf5  21.Ng5  Bh6  22.h4  with level chances   If White insists on c4-c5 with  17.b4  then  17...a5 !  18.a3  axb4  19.axb4  and Black has a good position after  19...Bg5 !?  20.Ra1  Rxa1  21.Qxa1  h5  22.Bxf5  Bxf5. } 17... a5 { Preventing b2-b4; it will be difficult and slow for White to create queenside play after this. } 18.

Qb2+ Kh7 { White resigns.   The f3-pawn cannot be taken since  46.Nxf3  loses to  46...Bd3+  47.Kf2  Be3+  Final remarks  1. One of Black’s most important moves was 13...Nf6 forcing White to choose between giving up his e4-square or giving up his dark squares, as he did in the game.  2. Later, the control of the e4-square played a significant role. As the reader may have noticed, White’s position began to fall apart once his knight was forced out of e4, on move 32.   3. As we could observe in this game, Black should have good fighting chances along the f-file as long as he can control the c4-c5 break with pawns on a5 and b6, as he did in the game. } *

I would like to discuss how Black should arrange his pieces in one of the most typical situations where this structure will arise.

This idea was introduced in the early 1950’s and is still used today. The point is to cover the c7-square from White’s invasion cxd6 followed by Nb5-c7.

Ng6+ Ke8 { White resigns as mate is unavoidable.  Final remarks  1. The biggest fact to remember from this game is the ineffectiveness of White’s moves 21-23 – that is, the plan of Kh1 and then Bf2-g1-f2. Although this is a typical response to Black’s ...g6-g5-g4-g3 plan, it does not work as well as many believe.  2. Black’s 23...h4 ! played a key role in this win, as it is the best way to open lines on the kingside in order to checkmate White’s king. The plan ...Nh5-g3 followed by ...h4-h3 is very strong and practically irresistible. } *

Then  21...Qc8 !?  22.Nd5  Nxd5  23.Qxd5+  Kh8  24.Qd1  Qe6  25.Rc1  +=  gives a substantial positional advantage for White, but Black can still hope to become active on the Kingside with ...h6-h5 and ...g5-g4. } 2. a5 { After this move White is essentially winning. The c6-pawn combined with an invasion down the a-file will create decisive threats. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Loek van Wely – Sergey Krylov, Mallorca 2004@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game is an example of how White may block the kingside with g2-g4, and then have a free hand to advance with his queenside plans. } 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4 Nh5 10. Re1 Kh8 { This move has fallen out of fashion in the last three years, possibly due to Black’s poor scores.   Much more common is  10...f5  11.Ng5  Nf6  12.Bf3  c6  13.Be3  h6  14.Ne6  Bxe6  15.dxe6  with a complex and highly analyzed position. } 11. Nd2 Nf4 12. Bf1 f5 13. g3 { Another option is  13.a4 !?  a5  14.bxa5  Rxa5  15.Nb3  Ra8  16.a5  fxe4  17.Nxe4  as in Sokolov – Arakhamia-Grant, Gibraltar 2009. } 13... Nh5 14. c5 f4 { A general piece of advice for King’s Indian players is to decide beforehand whether an opposite-flanks race is likely to work or not. If Black is likely to lose the race, then he should not start it at all, and instead should attempt to find counter-chances by keeping the central tension. In this case, the way White’s kingside structure is set up should be a red flag for Black. In previous examples Black’s attack has proven effective due to the advance ...g6-g5-g4-g3, but what is Black supposed to do in this case? Any feasible attack will take much longer, while White’s forces are already arriving at the queenside.   Much more principled is  14...Nf6  (preparing ...fxe4)  and now  15.cxd6 !?   while  15.Bg2  can be answered by the unorthodox  15...dxc5 !?  16.bxc5  fxe4  17.Ndxe4  Nfxd5  with level chances.  15...cxd6  16.b5  fxe4  17.Ndxe4  yields a level position } 15. Nc4 Ng8 { Not:  15...g5 ??  16.Qxh5  +-   A reasonable try was  15...Nf6  16.a4  g5  though after  17.Ra2  Ng6  18.Rc2  g4  19.Ba3  ± it seems Black will be unable to pose a real threat to White’s kingside. } 16. a4 { This is a fine multi-purpose move: it expands on the queenside and clears a2 for the rook to defend the second rank. } 16... Ngf6 17. Ra2 Ne8 { Black’s last two moves prepared  17...g5 ?  but unfortunately White is winning after  18.cxd6  cxd6  19.Nb5  since the d6-pawn cannot be protected. } 18. Rc2 { Another option was  18.g4 !?  Nhf6  19.f3  , which is similar to the game. } 18... Bd7 19. g4 { ± A good decision; Black’s attack was not really threatening, but it is better to simply close the kingside immediately, in order to have a free hand on the queenside. } 19... Nhf6 20. f3 h5 { A healthier alternative was  20...g5  21.b5  h5  but after  22.h3  ± Black does not seem to be getting anywhere, while White’s queenside expansion keeps on rolling. } 21. g5 { Closing the kingside decisively. } 21... Nh7 22. h4 { Black’s only hope to create counterplay on the kingside is to sacrifice a piece with ...Nxg5, but this is very unlikely to work, as White may easily blockade the kingside pawns, or simply continue pursuing his already-advanced queenside plan. White, on the other hand, has a very significant spatial advantage over the entire board, and the remainder of this game is an illustration of how he may exploit his enormous positional advantage. } 22... Rf7 23. Na5 Bc8 { 23...b6  , attempting to open up some lines, doesn’t help due to  24.cxb6  cxb6  25.Nc6  Qc8  26.b5 !?  +- followed by  Ra2  and a4-a5. } 24. c6 { Gaining even more space. As before, the c6-pawn secures White a winning queenside advantage. Since in this game Black cannot find counterplay on the kingside, the rest of the game is rather easily decided. } 24... b6 { Accepting a lost position.   But  24...bxc6 ?  loses after  25.Nxc6  Qd7  26.Rh2 !  followed by  Bh3  trapping the queen. } 25. Nc4 { The threat is a4-a5 opening up the a-file immediately, thus it is necessary to play: } 25... a6 { A new phase in the game has begun. Black’s pieces are so constrained they cannot play, hence Black will spend the next twenty moves simply waiting for the end. Meanwhile, White has complete freedom to manoeuvre in order to find the right winning method. Note how Black is ready to close the queenside. If White plays a4-a5, then Black replies ...b6-b5, and if White plays b4-b5, then Black replies ...a6-a5. Therefore, when White decides to push one of his queenside pawns, he will need to think how exactly he desires to sacrifice a piece in order to break Black’s last line of defence. } 26. Rh2 { This prophylactic move is intended to keep an eye on the kingside in case Black attempts the shake things up with ...Nxg5.   If  26.a5  b5  the position is momentarily closed. } 26... Kg8 27. Ree2 { The manoeuvring begins. } 27... Nf8 28. Bd2 Nh7 29. Be1 Nf8 30. Ra2 Nh7 31. Kh1 Nf8 32. Bf2 { Note how all of White’s pieces are aiming toward the queenside. } 32... Rb8 33. Bd3 Nh7 34. b5 { The positional threat is a4-a5 opening up two decisive lines on the queenside, and there is nothing better than: } 34... a5 { The game is entirely closed, and now White will prepare the decisive break.   Even worse is  34...axb5 ?  35.axb5  as White wins on the spot after  35...Bf8  36.Qa4  Bg7  37.Qa7.   If  34...Ra8  then  35.a5 !  opens up the queenside decisively:  35...axb5  36.Nxb5  bxa5  37.Be1  Bf8  38.Nxa5  +- The c6-pawn prevents Black’s manoeuvres, making White’s queenside invasion easy. } 35. Ne2 { The beginning of a lengthy yet winning manoeuvre: Nc3-e2-c1-b3xa5. } 35... Bf8 { Attempting to create counterplay with  35...Nxg5 !?  is refuted by:  36.hxg5  Qxg5  37.Qg1 !  Qh6  Black hopes to push  ...g6-g5  , but now  38.Bxb6 !  cxb6  39.Nxb6  decides the game due to the creation of two powerful passed pawns. } 36. Nc1 Bg7 { Again  36...Nxg5  is met by  37.hxg5  Qxg5  38.Qg1 !?  +-   or  38.Bh4  Qh6  39.Qg1  +- } 37. Nb3 Bf8 38. Bf1 { There is no hurry. } 38... Be7 39. Qe1 Ra8 { Now  39...Nxg5 !?  can be met by  40.hxg5  Bxg5  41.Bg1 !?  followed by  Rag2  and wins. } 40. Ra3 Bf8 41. Nbxa5 { White gives up a piece to open up the game; the a- and b-pawns are unstoppable. } 41... bxa5 42. Nxa5 Ng7 43. Nc4 Nxg5 { A desperate attempt for counterplay.   Of course waiting will not help:  43...Rb8  44.Rb3  Ne8  45.a5  Ng7  46.b6  Ba6  47.b7  Followed by  Nd2  and pushing the a-pawn. } 44. hxg5 Qxg5 45. a5 Qd8 46. b6 cxb6 47. axb6 { White has two passed pawns on the sixth rank; the rest is simple. } 47... Rxa3 48. Nxa3 g5 49. Qb4 g4 50. Bh4 Be7 51. b7 Bxh4 52. b8=Q { Final remarks  1. Black’s biggest mistake was attempting a kingside attack with 14...f4. Instead, Black should have transformed the structure into a King’s Indian Type III-B with 14...Nf6 and 15...fxe4 obtaining a playable position by analogy with the previous games.  2. Unlike previous examples, White’s kingside pawns on f2-g3-h2 are hard to attack, as there is no clear target. This fact made Black’s attack ineffective, besides which Black was already far behind when this race began.  3. The reason White was winning after 22.h4 was that he had an enormous space advantage all over the board. As we will see in the next example, closing the kingside by itself does not guarantee an advantage if Black can secure some space on the queenside.  Throughout this book I have been hesitant to include rapid games  (let alone blindfold chess)  , as I prefer games played at the highest level. In this case, I thought it was worthwhile making an exception, as in the next game Carlsen’s execution is simply superb and an ideal example for the position. } *
