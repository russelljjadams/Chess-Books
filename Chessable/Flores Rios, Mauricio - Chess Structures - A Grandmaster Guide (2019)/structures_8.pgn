[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@How Black trades his light-squared bishop@@HeaderEnd@@  A recurring question in this structure is how Black should make use of his light-squared bishop. In the earlier example Van Wely – Karjakin, we saw how useless this bad bishop can be, while the game Maze – Ni Hua was an example of this bishop’s potential outside the pawn chain. The latter example came from a line of the Caro-Kann Defence in which Black automatically gets his bishop outside the chain on move 3. Since Black does not achieve this in the French Defence, what should he make of this bishop? In many cases the best approach is to trade it with the typical ...b7-b6 and ...Ba6. Here is an example: } 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Be7 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Be2 b6 10. Nd1 a5 11.

Meanwhile Black is ready to play on the c-file. } 16... Bb4 { Simplifying the position even further. } 17. Qe3 Bxc3 18. bxc3 { A questionable decision; these c-pawns will be weak for the rest of the game.   A healthier option was  18.Bxc3  though after  18...Nc5  19.Bd4  Qc8  20.Rf3  Ne4  21.c3  Rb8 !

The analysis of this example is deliberately short as the message does not require much explanation. Black was able to obtain an excellent version of this structure by first trading light-squared bishops. Then the moves ...Be7-b4xc3 simplified the position to obtain a fight between Black’s strong knight and White’s bad bishop. White should have realized his kingside attack was unlikely to work, especially since his dark-squared bishop was incapable of contributing.  The reader should remember how Black can trade his light-squared bishop  (with ...Ba6)  and how poor White’s attack is without the right minor pieces – for example, without his light-squared bishop, or without a sufficient number of pieces. } *

[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@French Type III@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure will most typically arise from the Advance Variations of the French or the Caro-Kann but it can also be obtained from other openings, such as the Catalan after   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  Be7  5.Bg2  O-O  6.O-O  c6  7.Qc2  Nbd7  8.Nbd2  b6  9.e4  Bb7  10.e5  There is a strong similarity between the French Type Ill structure and the King's Indian Type III, which we studied in Chapter 16, which is a mirror version of this structure. Both in that structure and this one, there will be a fight on opposite flanks based on chain operations. White will want to hit near the base of Black's chain, the e6-pawn, with f2-f4-f5, while Black will try the same with ...c7-c5.  Similarly to the analogy we made in the previous chapter, there is one major difference between this structure and Chapter 16, and it is the location of the kings. In Chapter 16, Black was likely to play ...f7-f5-f4 gaining kingside space and therefore having chances for an attack. In contrast, it is White who has attacking chances in this structure because of his e5-pawn. Most likely Black will castle short, though we will also consider the case where Black decides to castle long.  Since this is a closed position, the colour of the bishops will play a significant role. Following the general rule, White's dark-squared bishop and Black's light-squared bishop will be considered 'bad'. But in practice, White's spatial advantage allows him to make good use of his dark-squared bishop. Even from c1, this bishop can prove helpful in a kingside attack. In contrast, if Black's bishop is on its initial square c8, it is likely to be a terrible piece, which is similar to what we learned in the game Van Wely - Karjakin from the previous chapter  (with reversed colours)  . On the other hand, if the black bishop is on f5 or g6, then it's a different story.  Now, let's discuss specific plans.  White's plans  1. Attack the base of Black's pawn chain with f2-f4-f5-fxe6.  2. Create a powerful kingside attack with f2-f4-f5-f6 followed by mate threats on the g7-square.  3. Attack Black's kingside with rooks along the third rank, a bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal, and a queen typically placed on h5. A piece sacrifice on the kingside is also likely to work well.  Black's plans  1. Attack the base of the chain, White's d4-pawn, with ...c7-c5xd4, ...Nc6, ...Qb6. In some cases use major pieces to invade along the c-file.  2. Advance ...c7-c5-c4, and then attack the new base of the chain  (the c3-pawn)  with ...b7-b5-b4. This plan can be too slow if White has good attacking chances on the kingside.  3. Trade light-squared bishops on the ^fl-a6 diagonal  (say with ...b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6)  or make good use of this bishop along the h7-b1 diagonal.  4. Slow down White's kingside attack with ...f7-f5, or even fight for counterplay with the more confrontational ...f7-f6.  White's Plans 1 and 2 are very effective while the centre remains firmly closed. The pawn chain and the spatial advantage prevent Black from effectively manoeuvring and defending the kingside. This allows White's checkmating attack and even piece sacrifices to work very well. For this reason Black must find a way to break in the centre or slow down the attack with either Plan 1 or Plan 4, that is ...c7-c5, ...f7-f6, or ...f7-f5.  White's Plan 3  (a kingside attack using pieces more than pawns, particularly a bishop on d3)  is not one I will cover in much detail in this chapter. Tactics will dominate, so it is not a good fit for my purposes. The extreme example is the Greek Gift - the bishop sacs on h7, then a knight check on g5 and queen to h5. All great fun and still winning a few points in the 21st century, but a topic for another day.  Black's Plan 1 can be very effective if White is unable to defend the d4-pawn or unable to cover the c2-square, which is the entry point for Black's rooks. If White can protect both these points well, then this plan can be a big disappointment, since the capture ...cxd4 means Black no longer has a queenside break to execute. Meanwhile White can proceed with his desired kingside attack. Something to note about Black's Plan 2 is that this plan is rather slow, and therefore it is far more likely to work well if Black has castled long, away from White's kingside play. In such a case, this plan can also be combined with a potential kingside attack based on ...f7-f6, ...g7-g5 and so on.  The first game in this chapter illustrates how White is able to give up control of the c-file and still have a good position as long as he can control Black's entry points  (the c2- and c1-squares)  . White then proceeds with his standard f4-f5 plan.  The second example illustrates a particular type of plan that is not always relevant to this structure  (and partly for that reason I did not mention it in the list above)  but is important if Black's light-squared bishop is exchanged on g6. Then once Black has recaptured with ...hxg6, White can go for an h4-h5 break and subsequent kingside attack.  The third game is an example of Black's Plan 4 while the fourth game is a combination of Black's Plans 2 and 4. Then the last game brings together many of Black's ideas into one elegant example. } 1. -- *

One of my students said, ”Black’s obviously better, as he dominates the c-file, and has a strong knight on c4.” Then I asked, ”How exactly do you make use of the c-file?” and suddenly he began to hesitate. When I first studied this game I thought White had to fight for equality, but this superficial evaluation was simply wrong. After a long analysis, I concluded Black is already in very serious trouble, as he cannot create serious threats on the queenside. Black’s position looks okay, to say the least, but there aren’t real entry points down the c-file, since the c2-square is protected. In addition, White does not have any weakness on the queenside.   Then, why should White be better in this position? White’s advantage is a result of his space, his ability to protect the c2-square and the d4-pawn. In addition, Black’s kingside was weakened by ...g7-g6, which does not mix well with the e6-d5 chain by weakening dark squares and allowing White to break with h4-h5. } 21...

Bf1 { The bishop on g2 was rather useless, and this move has two purposes:  1. To clear the second rank for a future transfer Re2-f2 to support g3-g4 and f4-f5.   2. To prepare a future Bf1-d3 to attack the kingside along the b1-h7 diagonal. } 3...

Final remarks  1. The capture 10...hxg6 changed the nature of the position, as the h4-h5 break became stronger than the typical f4-f5 break.  2. Black’s biggest problem was an incorrect positional evaluation. White’s d4-pawn was well protected, and the plan ...c5-c4, ...b7-b5-b4 was far too slow against White’s h4-h5 break. If Black had realized this opposite-flank race was lost, he probably would have played 11...Qc7 in order to castle long.  3. In retrospect, I believe 14...f6 was a reasonable option. It certainly looks terrible as the pawns on e6, f6 and g6 make a very vulnerable team. However, by trading the e5-pawn White’s attacking chances are reduced and Black manages to stay in the game for longer. } *

O-O { Over the last couple of years the move  9.Rb1 !?  has become more popular, as White wants to open the b-file to have an attack once Black castles queenside. Recent games have continued with:  9...Ne7   but  9...Qc7 !?  is enough to prevent b2-b4 for the moment, obtaining a position similar to the game  10.b4  cxb3  11.Nxb3  The b-file is open, and now if Black attempts to win an exchange with  11...Ba4  then simply:  12.Nxa5 !

Ne7 10. Rb1 Qc7 11. Ne1 { Opening the b-file with  11.b4 ?  no longer works due to:  11...cxb3  12.Nxb3  Ba4  ∓   Another possible plan was  11.Re1  Nc8  12.Nf1  Nb6  13.Bf4  Ba4  14.Qc1  Nb3  15.Qe3  when Black’s king will be safe on the queenside but White will expand on the kingside anyway. However, the game will not be ”one-sided” as White’s kingside attack may become dangerous to his own king. Overall, chances are approximately equal as in the game Nakamura – Pelletier, Biel 2005. } 11... O-O-O 12. Bg4 Kb8 { But now: } 13. Nc2 { This is not the best way to proceed.   13.f4  was a better alternative, and after  13...g6  14.Ndf3  Bg7  15.Bh3  the position is complicated, but chances are approximately balanced. White must expand on the kingside with extreme care, so as not to allow strong counterplay. For example,  15...Rdg8  16.g4 ?  would certainly be a premature decision, since now  16...h5 !  gives Black an excellent game. } 13... Ba4 { A good and rather thematic move. This bishop permanently prevents White from obtaining queenside play, and now it also makes White’s manoeuvres more difficult due to the pin. } 14. Nf3 { To illustrate why the pin is annoying, notice that the normal  14.f4  can now be met by  14...h5 !?  15.Bh3   not  15.Bxh5 ?

Qe2 Nb6 { This knight transfer is very typical of the position; it reinforces the control of the queenside, and may help in a future expansion. The position is critical and White needs to find the right way to react on the kingside. } 16. h4 { But this is not it, as we shall see.   It was better to play  16.Ng5 !?  improving the knight:  16...h6  17.Nh3  Be7  18.Nf4 !?   or  18.f4 !?  with a normal position  (Now the knight is pretty good on f4, as it makes it difficult for Black to play ...f7-f5)  (or ...f7-f6)  (and helps prepare a slow-paced kingside expansion with g2-g3 and h2-h4-h5.) } 16... Ka8 { This is a normal move, but it misses a stronger continuation.   A strong option was:  16...f5 !  17.Bh3   Or  17.exf6  gxf6  when Black can soon develop an unpleasant kingside initiative. The e6-pawn is untouchable since  18.Bxe6 ?  loses to  18...Re8  followed by  ...Bd7.  17...h6  Black will continue with  ...Be7  ,  ...Rdg8  and  ...g5  with an extremely powerful kingside attack. } 17. h5 { White does not realize how many problems he is about to face. In fact, this move makes Black’s reaction even stronger, as the h5-pawn will become a target.   Again  17.Ng5  would have prevented Black’s strong kingside reaction with  ...f7-f5  and after  17...h6  18.Nh3  g6  19.Bf4  the game is approximately balanced. } 17... f5 { A wonderful move! A double exclamation mark is not an exaggeration: the move is both strong and nearly decisive. This is a reaction the reader should never forget: by using a tactical resource, Black achieves the ...f7-f5 push, after which he dominates the game for the following reasons:  1. He clearly controls the queenside; he has nothing to fear on this flank.  2. He can now begin to expand on the kingside with an eventual ...g7-g5.   3. He can easily create an attack against White’s king.  4. White is inferior on both flanks, hence he cannot create counterplay. } 18. Bh3 { It is probably better to take on  f6  , in order to prevent Black’s kingside expansion with  ...g7-g5  , but in this case  18.exf6  gxf6  does not really help White either, since his position is so weakened:  19.Re1   not  19.Bxe6 ?  Re8  -+ followed by  ...Bd7  19...Re8  20.Bh3  Bd6  21.Ne3  Qf7  ∓ Black is about to create a strong attack down the g-file, and the h5-pawn is falling.

For example:  20.g3  Rg8  21.Kh2  Bxc2  22.Qxc2  Be7  23.Qe2   23.Bxh6 ?  loses a piece to  23...Qh5  23...Bg5  24.Rg1  Rdf8  ∓ With threats such as  ...f5-f4  or  ...Nb3. } 19... Qg8 20. Bf4 h6 21.

Rg3 Rh8 33. Bg4 Rh4 34. Rc1 Qe4 35. Bxf3 Qh7 { White had to resign.  Final remarks  1. The ...c5-c4 advance by Black had to be combined with long castling, and works especially well if White is unable to open the b-file with b2-b3.   2. Once Black has castled long, White may still expand on the kingside, but there is a chance this plan could backfire as White’s king can now become exposed.  3. Black’s 17th move ...f5 was an extremely strong blow. If Black manages to combine ...c5-c4 with the ...f7-f5 advance, then he has obtained a significant spatial advantage and White is in serious trouble all over the board. It is no surprise that Black was able to win easily afterwards, as there is little White can do to prevent Black’s active kingside play based on the ...g7-g5 expansion. } *

This ‘bad’ bishop is actually very powerful when it is outside the pawn chain. } 16. Bg2 O-O 17. f5 { And this is the most critical moment in the game.

By analogy with the game Maze – Ni Hua from the previous chapter, Black’s bishop was strong on the h7-b1 diagonal, as it was an obstacle to the f4-f5 break, provided protection to the kingside, and emerged as a powerful attacking piece once the f- and e-pawns came off the board. } *

Black did not capture with 13...cxd4 as the first game in the chapter showed us the c-file is not useful if the entry points are covered, as was the case here. Later, Black implemented the ...f7-f6 break to gain counterplay along the f-file and to prevent White from further advance, in similar style to Gopal – Bologan.  The ...f7-f6 break combined with having a bishop along the h7-b1 diagonal meant Black was able to stop White’s kingside play altogether. This gave him time to pursue the complete chain-advance plan. The advance ...c5-c4 turned the c3-pawn into the base, while the advance ...b4-b3 turned White’s b2-pawn into the base of the chain. The b2-pawn was harder to defend than the c3-pawn, which in turn was harder to defend than the d4-pawn. Since Black had time, he decided to go after the b2-pawn and he succeeded. This game was a beautiful illustration of these concepts. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The 3-3 vs. 4-2 Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  The 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure is very common. It typically arises from the Caro-Kann or Slav structures studied in Chapters 3 and 4. In the Caro-Kann we obtain this structure once Black plays ...c5 and White captures dxc5. In the Slav it occurs after Black plays ...e5 and White replies dxe5. Note that in the second case we reach this structure with reversed colours. This structure may also arise from the Scheveningen Sicilian, as we will discuss later in this chapter. The fact that this position is open allows for massive piece exchanges and it is quite common for players of all levels to agree to a draw upon arriving at this structure, just because of its seemingly drawish nature. Nevertheless, both sides have some ambitious plans.  White's plans  1. Control the d-file and use it for a seventh-rank invasion if possible.  2. Pursue a majority attack. That is, advance the queenside pawns to create a passed pawn.  Black's plans  1. Control the d-file and use it for a seventh-rank invasion if possible.  2. Pursue a minority attack with ...a7-a5 and ...b7-b5-b4. If this plan is successful Black will probably eliminate White's a-, b-, and c-pawns using his a- and b-pawns. Thereupon Black will attempt to win an endgame with 4 vs. 3 kingside pawns.  Something to note is that both sides play on the queenside. This is quite logical since in the majority of cases the kings will be castled on the kingside. Attempting a kingside attack in such an open position is quite likely to backfire for either side. Of course there are exceptions to this rule, and an attack could succeed if pieces are already actively placed when we reach this structure. Nevertheless, I would not recommend starting a kingside attack from scratch as the opponent is likely to find a refutation in the centre or on the queenside.  Something to be aware of is that because this structure is quite open, the pair of bishops tends to be more important here than in other structures studied in this book. Overall, this structure is quite simple strategically speaking, but it is by no means drawish, and it is good to know how to proceed with either side. } 1. -- *

A red flag for White should have been the b5-pawn, which hinted that a queenside expansion would not be achievable hence White should stay passive.  3.

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Panov Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  When you see the name 'Panov Structure' you might guess IQP, but instead I shall give this name to the structure you can see above, which usually originates from the Panov variation of the Caro-Kann after   1.e4  c6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  cxd5  4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Nc6  6.Nf3  when White later plays c4-c5.  This structure may also arise from the Queen's Indian Defence, as well as any position with a Carlsbad structure.  White's plans  The main plan is clear: create a passed pawn on the queenside. If White is able to play b2-b4-b5 and later c5-c6, then he is likely to have a big advantage.  Black's plans  Black can counter this plan with two different approaches:  1. Attack the front of White's chain  (the c5-pawn)  with ...b7-b6. This is done in order to trade the c5-pawn, eliminating White's most dangerous threat.  2. Attack the base of the chain  (the d4-pawn)  by placing a knight on c6 and a bishop on f6. This is often combined with playing ...f7-f5 and placing a strong knight on e4.  Black's Plans 1 and 2 can often be combined effectively. Overall the Panov structure is a relatively simple one, though we should know its basic plans. Here I present a couple of short fragments to illustrate how White creates a passed pawn, how Black fights for counterplay, and then we finish our discussion with an example of how a Carlsbad structure is converted into a Panov. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Dragon Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Dragon Formation arises almost exclusively from the Dragon or Accelerated Dragon lines of the Sicilian. It may also occur with reversed colours when White plays the English Opening and Black replies with 1...e5 followed by 2...Nf6 and 3...d5. Assuming we have the structure with colours the usual way around  (say, from a Dragon)  then Black almost always castles short while White must choose whether to castle short or long. This decision has a significant influence on the character of the resulting game.  White's plans  1. If White castles long, then he will assault Black's kingside with h2-h4-h5, and then attempt a mating attack along the h-file.  2. If White castles short, then he will play a central strategy, place a rook on the d-file and a knight on d5.  Black's plans  1. If White castles long, then Black must create a queenside attack at all costs. Black will often play along the c-file as well as push his a- and b-pawns. An exchange sacrifice ...Rxc3, with the idea of doubling pawns, is often possible.  2. If White castles short, then Black can play a more positional game along the c-file. Place a knight on c4, and again the idea of an exchange sacrifice with ...Rxc3 may be possible.  Something to note about White's Plan 2 is that if Black captures the knight on d5 with a piece, and White recaptures with exd5, then the structure is very similar to the asymmetric transformation of the Maroczy, which we studied in Chapter 11.  After such a brief overview, many readers may wonder if the infamous Dragon is really that simple. The truth is that this structure often yields extremely complex positions, but the complexity is mostly tactical. There are few strategic elements to discuss, as most games are decided by brutal tactical shots. This is the reason I decided not to give a separate chapter to this structure. Nevertheless, one interesting idea in this structure is Black's exchange sacrifice on c3, and we will see an example of it. } 1. -- *

White’s queenside is so seriously damaged by the doubled c-pawns that White is unable to organize an effective defence.  3. It is important to note the key role being played by Black’s knight on e5, which covers many essential squares and prevents White’s attack from succeeding. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Scheveningen Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  The Scheveningen structure is one of the most exciting and complicated pawn structures in chess. This structure can arise from almost every variation of the Sicilian, such as the Najdorf, Scheveningen, Classical, Paulsen, Taimanov and many other less prominent lines. Of course, this structure also arises very often in the English Opening with colours reversed when Black plays 1...e5 followed by 2...Nf6 and 3...d5.  White's plans  1. Launch a kingside attack with g2-g4-g5, h2-h4-h5 and then break with g5-g6.  2. Play f2-f4-f5 to pressure the e6-pawn and create an attack along the a2-g8 diagonal.  3. Play f2-f4 and then e4-e5 and then later carry out a kingside attack.  Black's plans  1. Achieve the central break ...d6-d5 to release the position and activate his minor pieces.  2. Play along the c-file, and place a knight on c4 to pressure the b2-pawn and undermine White's knight which is typically located on c3.  3. If White has castled long, then carry out a queenside attack with ...b7-b5-b4, ...a7-a5-a4 and then the break ...b4-b3.  4. If White plays f2-f4, in some cases Black can reply ...g7-g5 to fight for the control of the e5-square.  5. In some cases, Black may sacrifice an exchange on c3, in similar style to what we saw in the Dragon structure.  Black will most likely castle short or on some occasions keep the king in the centre. Meanwhile, White's king must choose between long and short castling, which will greatly influence the development of the game. If White castles long, then his main lines plans will be 1 and 2 while Black will most probably focus on Plan 3. Instead, if White castles short, Black will focus on Plan 1 while White can still carry out a kingside attack. White's Plan 3 is more likely to work after short castling, because the rooks would be placed more favourably for this plan.  Structure transformations  This structure can transpose into some of the structures we have studied previously.  1. If Black plays ...d6-d5 and White replies with e4-e5 then we obtain a French Type II structure  (Chapter 15)  .  2. If Black plays ...d6-d5, White captures e4xd5 and Black recaptures with a piece, then we obtain a 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure.  3. If White plays f2-f4-f5, the pressure on e6 may provoke Black to play ...e6-e5 obtaining a Najdorf Type II structure  (Chapter 9)  .  4. On some occasions, White may play c2-c4 arriving at a Hedgehog structure  (Chapter 10)  .  The second structure transformation above is often favourable for Black on a positional level. The reason is that Black often has his b-pawn already on b5, which is the starting point of Black's minority attack, as described earlier in this chapter.  The 4th structure transformation is quite unlikely to work because White typically has his knight on c3 and cannot afford to move it away in order to play c2-c4.  Overall the Scheveningen is a very interesting pawn structure and deserves study. The reason I do not cover it in more detail is because the strategic ideas in this structure are relatively simple while most of its complexity comes from tactical details which do not fit so well with the content of this book. I am a firm believer that the reader needs most help with strategic concepts, as tactical shots can readily be studied using the ever more powerful computer engines. Here we will see only one example of White's attack once Black plays ...d6-d5 with the king still in the centre. Then we will see a brief discussion of Black's Plan 4. } 1. -- *

Black is able to make good use of two half-open files  (c and g)  while White cannot easily do similar, especially with the d-file so cluttered.  3. White’s e4-pawn is isolated and vulnerable. Meanwhile, the bishop on d3 is close to useless.  Something to note is that Black’s king stayed in the centre, which is by no means a problem. In fact, it is a standard approach in Scheveningen structures, especially after Black has installed a knight on e5, which ensures the safety of the king. Black has a great position, and White blundered just two moves later, so we will leave our analysis at this point, though the reader is encouraged to analyze this position and convince himself of Black’s superiority. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Benko Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure is actually specific to the Benko variation which begins with   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  3.d5  b5  4.cxb5  a6  5.bxa6  After the a6-pawn drops, Black is a pawn down but has some positional advantages to compensate for it. They are:  1. White has two pawn 'islands', while Black only has one rock-solid group of six pawns.  2. Black will place his rooks on the a- and b-files, pressuring White's a- and b-pawns, preventing their advance.  3. White does not have obvious targets and may have to limit himself to passive play for a long time in order to stabilize his position.  Theory regards the Benko Gambit as being somewhat inferior, and in fact, it is rarely seen at the elite level nowadays. Nevertheless, it is an excellent practical weapon to be used when one absolutely needs to win with Black. Now, a big question is: How should White play?  There are two main strategies to be followed, and they are often combined:  1. White must turn his queenside pawns into a fortress, which most probably will be on b3 and a4, combined with many minor pieces surrounding and defending these pawns.  2. Advance in the centre and obtain a central break with e4-e5 or maybe f4-f5. These ideas are borrowed from the asymmetric Benoni structure from Chapter 12, and they are White's only active plan. That is, White must try one of these breaks sooner or later. If instead White attempts to trade his b-pawn for Black's c5-pawn, then White's a-pawn will hardly be enough to win, as it will be an easy target for Black's pieces. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Closed Ruy Lopez@@HeaderEnd@@  The Closed Ruy Lopez structure pictured on the left is one that arises almost exclusively from the Ruy Lopez opening. It is a very interesting structure, but I decided not to have a full chapter about it because it originates from just one opening, and because it is closely related to the King's Indian structures. The nature of this position most closely resembles the King's Indian Type II structure, the only difference being the pawns on c3 vs. c4  (instead of c4 vs. c5)  . This is, in fact, a big difference, as we will see in the typical plans for this position:  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack with g2-g4, Nbd2-f1-g3-f5, sacrifice a piece on f5 if needed.  2. Create a kingside attack with f2-f4, by analogy with Chapter 15.  3. Play on the queenside with b2-b4, a2-a4 and then invade on the a-file or attack one of Black's queenside pawns.  Black's plans  1. Create queenside play with ...a7-a5, ...b7-b5-b4.  2. Expand on the kingside with ...f7-f5-f4 by analogy with Chapters 15 and 16.  A major structural difference between this structure and the King's Indian structures is that in the Ruy Lopez White doesn't have a spatial advantage on the queenside. Still, having a powerful pawn on d5 is always a plus and will allow White to create queenside play on occasion.  Nevertheless, kingside plans are now more significant than ever for White, and it is important to keep them in mind as queenside play will not always work for him. Unlike pretty much all King's Indian-type positions, Black is now likely to succeed by playing actively on the queenside, though the kingside plans remain valid. But often White will pay so much attention to the kingside that Black will opt for queenside plans. For this reason, in many cases, White will first devote his energies to closing the queenside, and only then move on to a kingside attack. } 1. -- *

Final remarks  1. The fact that White obtained a superior position after some pawns were traded on the queenside should be no surprise. We have seen similar patterns in Chapter 14. The key is the spatial advantage provided by the d5-pawn and the c6-square. In this game, this is what made it so easy for White to attack the b5-pawn.  2. Black’s biggest mistake was playing the premature 12...c4, permitting the strong 13.b4. This move allowed White to neutralize Black’s queenside play immediately, and later obtain chances for an advantage as the position opened up. } *

{ Similarly to the King’s Indian Complex which we studied in Chapter 18, the Lopez Formation is a very flexible structure. The name ‘Lopez Formation’ was introduced by Soltis in the 1970’s and refers to the fact that this structure almost always arises from the Ruy Lopez. In essence, this structure is one in transition. Depending on how White and Black proceed in the centre, this structure will be transformed in one of the following ways:  1. White advances d4-d5 and later c3-c4, obtaining a King’s Indian Type II structure  (Chapter 15)  .  2. White advances d4-d5 and Black replies ...c5-c4, to obtain a Closed Ruy Lopez, which has just been covered.  3. White captures d4xe5  (or d4xc5)  and Black recaptures ...d6xe5  (or ...d6xc5)  , obtaining a typical transformation of the King’s Indian Complex  (Chapter 18)  .  4. Black captures ...e5xd4 and after c3xd4 White proceeds with d4-d5, obtaining an Asymmetric Benoni  (Chapter 12)  .  5. Black captures ...c5xd4 and after c3xd4 White proceeds with d4-d5, obtaining a King’s Indian Type I structure  (Chapter 14)  .  6. Black trades two pawns on d4 with ...c5xd4 followed by ...e5xd4  (or in the other order)  . The resulting position has not been discussed in previous chapters, and here we will see an example of it. } 1. -- *
