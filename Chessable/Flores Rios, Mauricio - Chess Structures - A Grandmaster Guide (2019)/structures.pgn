{ @@HeaderStart@@Foreword@@HeaderEnd@@  I first met Mauricio ten years ago, as we both competed in Pan-American youth competitions. Later we both received a chess scholarship to attend the University of Texas at Brownsville. We were teammates for four years and spent countless hours studying chess together, though our training preferences were very different. Mauricio read books, analyzed his games and prepared openings. I did these things too, but in reality, the vast majority of my time was spent looking over current chess games and playing. I was surprised when Mauricio told me he had written a book partially inspired by my training methods, and I was certainly interested to see what was in it.  The truth about my training method is that looking over a game for just a couple of minutes can actually be a wonderful investment, if done correctly. The key is searching for repeating patterns; this takes some practice but is feasible. In my career, I have seen close to 100,000 chess games, including most of the grandmaster-level games played over the past decade. The cumulative experience from spending a minute or two on each of these games has allowed me to gain an excellent positional understanding. Staring at a position for a few seconds is often enough for me to see who is better, which plans will work, which pieces should be traded, etc.  Acquiring such a level of experience and positional knowledge requires many years. Going through thousands and thousands of games takes a very long time, even if you only spend a couple of minutes on each. Most importantly, being able to actually see the patterns does not come easily to everyone. Addressing these two difficulties is exactly the purpose of this book.  Chess Structures - A Grandmaster Guide is an excellent selection of model games. By studying the 140 games and fragments in this book, the reader will learn many of the most important plans, patterns and ideas in chess. The organization of this book is particularly helpful in this regard. The pawn structure is the most important factor to determine the nature of a game; therefore, studying model games classified by structure allows the reader to acquire reliable strategic knowledge much more easily. Mauricio's detailed explanations allow the reader to identify the key elements in each example. Moreover, each game constitutes a building block toward the understanding of the structure as a whole.  I am certain the readers of this book will find it both useful and entertaining. They will complete the opening phase understanding the strategic landscape of the position. Most importantly, studying this book will help them to better understand the opening itself, and even to choose variations depending on what middlegame position they wish to play. I give this book my highest recommendation, and I feel sure readers will profit from it.  GM Axel Bachmann  Ciudad del Este, Paraguay  December 2014 }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Preface@@HeaderEnd@@  The idea for this book was in the back of my mind for several years before coming to fruition. The book was born out of my desire to guide players who, like me, struggle to apply their strategic knowledge to a practical game. My aim is to provide something new to chess literature; to write the book I should have studied myself earlier in my career. This is not the typical strategy book, but before I tell you what this book is, let me tell you how I realized this book is necessary, especially for self-learners.  My progress in chess was very fast, but very difficult, even frustrating. Due to geographical and financial constraints I drew most of my knowledge from books, rather than learning from an experienced master. I studied many strategy books and I remember embracing every word in them as a piece of gold written in ink. However, as I scaled the rating ladder I was dazzled by my inability to correctly evaluate positions despite my supposedly vast strategic knowledge. I was well versed in modem strategy but sometimes the concepts in my books were contradictory, or difficult to apply in practice. I often lost games without ever understanding the reason; my books had no answers!  By the time I had become a FIDE Master, I had concluded that the strategic rules in my books only worked sometimes, and this was not good enough. I was afraid to use potentially incorrect rules and I changed my style to avoid dealing with them. I became a strong tactician and avoided strategy at all costs. Unfortunately, I could not always obtain sharp positions and in quiet games my lack of understanding often led me to lose miserably. In fact, I became a grandmaster at eighteen knowing less than half of this book's contents.  There already exist dozens of books providing an excellent introduction to chess strategy, and I recommend you read one. These books are a starting point, but they are insufficient. They teach strategic elements without shedding much light on which factors will play a bigger role in a specific position. It is like giving you several tools without telling you which one to use. A different class of strategy book provides many concrete examples and shows how the strategic tools are selected and used. Such books are often entertaining and even inspiring, but they lack specificity. At times reading these books can leave you more confused than before, as you have learned rules but do not exactly know when to apply them. My experience as a coach has only confirmed this phenomenon.  Chess Structures - A Grandmaster Guide emphasizes clarity, precision and completeness over generality. I do not intend to teach rules applicable to every position. Such rules typically do not exist. Moreover, even if such rules existed, the chance that such a complex message will be misunderstood is far too high. Let's not risk it! My aim is to provide an easy-to-understand strategic guide to the most frequently-occurring classes of positions in chess. I hope readers will find this helpful, as it greatly reduces ambiguity; it is clear when rules will be valid and when they will not. In this sense, this book is a collection of analyzed model games, logically organized into families of similar positions with common strategic ideas. As Capablanca said in his book Chess Fundamentals, every player should have a collection of games and ideas within his chess knowledge. This book intends to provide developing players with a fine selection of such games and ideas. These games are presented within the context of well-defined classes, to enhance the learning process and prevent confusion.  Naturally, the best  (and least ambiguous)  way to classify chess positions is based on their pawn structure. I divide this book into twenty-four chapters, which discuss the most interesting and common structures in modern practice. These positions encompass a wide variety of openings and middlegames, which are present in the vast majority of all chess games. I hope my readers will find this book to be a practical and, most importantly, an accessible guide to learning how these specific positions should be conducted.

{ @@HeaderStart@@What you will find in this book@@HeaderEnd@@  This book is divided into twenty-two chapters describing some of the most important and common structures in chess. Two final chapters contain a compilation of exercises and detailed solutions.  Deciding which structures deserved a chapter, and which did not proved challenging, but I am satisfied with the final selection. Chapters are ordered so that similar structures are close to one another. In fact, these structures are implicitly divided into five classes or families, each of which is more closely associated with one particular type of opening. Learning all structures within a family is very useful, as players must frequently decide between two options that yield different, yet related, structures. It is helpful to know which structure will prove more favourable. These five families are as follows:  Family One: d4 and ...d5  This family consists of the structures that will typically arise when the moves d2-d4 and ...d7-d5 occur early in the game. Typical openings would be the Queen's Gambit Orthodox Defence, the Slav or the Queen's Indian Defence, but there are many others, such as the Scandinavian, the Caro-Kann or the Alapin Variation against the Sicilian Defence. This family encompasses Chapters 1 through 7. In addition, I discuss the Panov structure in the Caro-Kann and the 3-3 vs. 4-2 pawn structure, which are related to this family, in Chapter 22.  Family Two: Open Sicilian  This family includes those structures that typically occur in the Open Sicilian. It focuses on two types of positions: those that occur when Black plays ...e7-e5 instead of ...e7-e6; and then Hedgehog and Maroczy positions. This family spans Chapters 8 through 11. The Scheveningen and Dragon structures are discussed in Chapter 22.  Family Three: Benoni  This small family is devoted to those structures in which Black confronts the queen's pawn opening with a ...c7-c5 strategy and White replies with d4-d5. Later, when Black challenges the centre with ...e7-e6 and ...exd5, White must choose between cxd5 and exd5. Chapter 12 is devoted to studying the first option, which is typically known as a Benoni-type position, while Chapter 13 studies the alternative exd5. The related Benko structure is discussed in Chapter 22.  Family Four: King's Indian  This family of five chapters is devoted to the multiple types of structure arising from the King's Indian Defence and its relatives. It is an extremely interesting and complex group of chapters to study, but it contains plenty of tactical and strategic ideas. This family encompasses Chapters 14 to 18. The related structures of the Closed Ruy Lopez and Lopez Formation are discussed in Chapter 22.  Family Five: French  This family of three chapters studies the pawn chains that typically arise in the French Defence. It should be noted that such structures often occur in the Sicilian, the anti-Sicilian, the English Opening, the Catalan and many others. It covers Chapters 19 to 21.  Miscellaneous Chapter  As you may see from the list above, Chapter 22 covers many structures. This chapter allows me to discuss structures which are in some sense too 'strategically limited' to deserve a full chapter, or simply not so popular. Still, this chapter presents some of the interesting points of these structures and deserves a close look.  Structure selection  Naturally, it would be impossible to cover every structure. It was a challenge to decide which structures were worthy of inclusion, and which ones were not. I gave priority to the following:  Strategic over tactical: I prefer discussing structures with a substantial strategic component. Structures like the Dragon are discussed only briefly in Chapter 22. The reason is that tactics and opening knowledge tend to predominate, offering fewer long-term plans for us to study.  Frequent over rare: I gave priority to those structures that arise more often, to offer a practical selection that the reader would be likely to encounter in play. Rare structures are not included.  Fixed over flexible: Plans often begin to form after something happens with the pawn structure. That is, pawns are traded, a pawn chain is formed or there is tension in the centre. This creates a semistable pawn structure. I only chose structures in which this was the case. If there is no pawn contact whatsoever, then multiple options remain open, but the game is likely to reach one of our structures at a later stage.  Generally relevant over specific: I tried to avoid structures that occur in only one opening. For this reason, I do not discuss the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, or the doubled pawn arising in the Trompowsky, or the Winawer or MacCutcheon variations of the French. I do mention the Benko structure in Chapter 22, but primarily because it is relevant to the asymmetric Benoni studied in Chapter 12.  Exercises  The book concludes with a collection of fifty positional and tactical exercises, which reinforce the ideas presented. I attempted to sort these problems from easiest to hardest, but this is merely my own evaluation. If the reader struggles with later exercises, he is likely to find inspiration by solving earlier problems. I provide detailed explanations to all of these exercises. In fact, some of these solutions convey pieces of knowledge that are not thoroughly developed in the corresponding chapter, in an attempt to keep this textbook concise and to make the exercises interesting. The reader is encouraged to first attempt the exercises, and then read these solutions as an additional chapter of supplemental examples.  Game selection  The most challenging aspect of writing this book was selecting suitable examples for the concepts I wanted to illustrate. I became so ambitious in my aim to provide a fine collection that I reviewed approximately 20,000 recent games. When I selected games, I prioritized:  - Quality of execution  - Tactical simplicity, when appropriate  - Recent games over older games  - Visually appealing games  I want this book to explain mistakes made by all levels of players. I certainly did not want to omit those mistakes the best players in the world could make. Excessive tactical complications often make the strategic message rather blurry. Therefore, I avoided sharp tactics whenever it was possible and reasonable. Recent games have obvious advantages over older games. First, the reader is unlikely to bore himself with something he already knows; second, recent games illustrate mistakes players make nowadays, instead of those they used to make in the past. By the past, I mean three, four or five decades ago when strategic knowledge was far less advanced than it is today. Finally, I made an effort to choose beautiful games whenever possible, simply because I would like the readers to enjoy this book.  How to use this book  I understand many readers have limited time and do not wish to read an entire book if they are only likely to encounter a few of the pawn structures I discuss. For this reason, chapters are largely self-contained, while similar chapters will be found close to one another and arranged in a logical sequence. I took great care in ordering chapters so that all required knowledge would be available when needed. Many pawn structures can transpose to another. If structure B is likely to transpose to structure A, then I mention structure A at an earlier stage in the book. When the reader studies structure B, he will be able to understand whether transposing to structure A is favourable or not. This makes the learning process run smoothly and comprehensively.  Nevertheless, I would recommend that readers study this book in its entirety even if their current repertoire is unlikely to include all of these structures. Learning new structures opens your mind to new ideas and could do wonders for your chess.  Prior works  I am aware that other authors have already discussed similar structures as I do in my book. This fact drove me to expand this book beyond my original objective. I studied previous works in depth, as my ambition was to produce the most detailed treatment on the subject yet. I am convinced this book will be a great contribution to the study of chess structures. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Isolani@@HeaderEnd@@  The isolated queen's pawn - referred to here as the isolani - is an extremely important pawn structure. It arises in many opening variations; the Queen's Gambit accepted, Slav, Tarrasch Defence, Sicilian Alapin or French Tarrasch to name a few. This structure is equally common with either colour, but for our discussion in this chapter we will assume it is White who has the isolani.  Generally speaking, White has better middlegame prospects, while Black has better prospects in an endgame. Therefore, White's main aim will be to build an attack, while Black's hope will be to neutralize such an attack and simplify the position, obtaining a superior endgame.  Let's discuss some specific plans:  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack. Most standard plans will include the moves Ne5, Bg5 and the battery Qd3-Bc2. In some cases a piece sacrifice on the kingside is needed to break through the defence. Rooks are typically placed on e1 and d1  (or c1)  , and a rook transfer via the third rank is possible.  2. Break in the centre with d4-d5, trading pawns and opening lines with an overwhelming initiative  (or even sacrificing a pawn with the same purpose)  .  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to win an endgame. In particular, exchange White's good bishop  (the light-squared bishop)  .  2. Place a knight on d5. This prevents the central break d4-d5, and controls some key squares. In an endgame a rook, bishop or even a king would be strong on this square.  As we have seen, the plans in this structure are logical and easy to understand. Playing these positions, on the other hand, can be tricky. Great precision is required when calculating, and a good positional understanding is necessary in order to judge when the isolani provides good attacking chances  (or other compensation)  and when it is simply a weakness.  The games in this chapter show all of these common plans in some form or another. The last two games illustrate an interesting rule for evaluating whether the isolani provides enough attacking chances. As we will learn, the key is whether the player who has the isolani possesses his good bishop. The chapter finishes with a short fragment explaining the power of an isolani which has advanced to the fifth rank. }

{ The position is rather unclear, though approximately balanced.   As Edouard suggests, regaining the piece directly with  19.d5  exd5  20.Nxd7   20.Nxd5 ?  does not work due to  20...Nbxd5  21.Bxd5  Bb4 !  -+ followed by  Qe7  when White's attack is over  20...Qxd7  21.Qxe7  Qxe7  22.Rxe7  does not give an advantage to White, since after  22...Rfd8  Black obtains sufficient counterplay with  ...Nc4. }

20... Ng8 21. d5 Nc4
{ Another option was  21...exd5  which leads to a forced line:  22.Nxd5  Nc4  23.Qc3  Nxe5  24.Qxe5+  Bf6  25.Nxf6  Nxf6  26.Red1  Re8  27.Rxd7  Qxd7  28.Qxf6+  Kh7  29.g3 !?  when the position is dynamically balanced. }
22. Bxc4 bxc4 23. Rd4 Bc5
{ A blunder in time trouble.   It was difficult to find the only move  23...Qe8 !  after which White has plenty of choices leading to unclear play, for example  24.Ne4 !?  when White maintains many potential threats, and has enough compensation for the piece. }

The break d4-d5 was a predominant theme in this game; which prevented many of Black's desired moves.  2. The alternative 18.Bh4 would have given a pleasent, slow-paced but steady advantage.  3. Although the piece sacrifice 18.Bxh6 only gives equality, it is justified in practice, as White's attack was far easier to play than Black's defence. In many crucial variations Black was forced to find a series of only moves in order to survive. }

It is likely that Bologan did not properly assess how little counterplay he would have.   2. White's piece arrangement with pawns on e3/f3, Bf1, Bf2 and Nd4 was ideal. It covered most essential squares while maintaining a solid and dynamic position.   3. Black did not have a good response against the plan Rc3, Qc1 and b2-b3 followed by penetrating down the c-file. Therefore, Black's position was lost in practice ever since move 30. This means a defence was only possible assuming near-perfect play, which even a top-player like Bologan was unable to deliver. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Hanging Pawns@@HeaderEnd@@  The 'hanging pawns' structure arises in many openings and is closely related to the isolani. In fact, most hanging pawns arise from an isolani position, in which Black trades his knight on d5 for White's knight on c3. Later, White is likely to advance c3-c4 yielding the position in the diagram. Similar to the previous chapter, this structure is equally likely to arise with either colour, but for the moment we will assume it is White who has the hanging pawns. In general, White has better middlegame prospects due to his control of central squares and his spatial edge. Black, on the other hand, should aim for an endgame or a simplified position in which these pawns are likely to become a liability. In particular, if these pawns become blocked by Black's pieces, then they will become a crucial weakness accounting for an essentially lost position. Now, let's discuss specific ideas for both sides.  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack. Most plans will include the moves Ne5, Bc2, Qd3, and a likely rook transfer through the third rank, say with Re1-e3-h3.  2. Break in the centre with d4-d5, either to open lines for attack, or to create a powerful passed pawn on the d-file.  Black's plans  1. Trade off pieces atempting to neutralize the attack.  2. Pressure the central pawns, block them if possible.  3. Break the hanging pawns, either with ...b6-b5 or ...e6-e5. These breaks are not easy to carry out, especially because an experienced player will try and prevent them at all costs. However, if they can be accomplished they are generally very strong, as they weaken those squares covered by the hanging pawns, and often force White to accept an isolani under very unfavourable circumstances.  As the reader will notice, many ideas are shared between this structure and the previous one, and this should not be a surprise. These structures are members of the same family in a general sense. They are both open positions in which White enjoys a pleasant spatial advantage at the cost of some structural instability. Overall, I would say the standard hanging pawns position offers level chances and a complex game with winning chances for both sides. Precise calculation is often required to carry out  (or neutralize)  the attack and to find the right timing for the central breaks mentioned above.  The first two games in this chapter will illustrate how White may successfully break in the centre with d4-d5. In the first example, this break will create a decisive attack due to the opening of lines, while the second example will illustrate the power of a passed pawn advancing down the d-file. The third game is an illustration of White's attacking potential within a modified structure which often arises from the hanging pawns. The last three games in the chapter illustrate  (with reversed colours)  how Black may play against the hanging pawns. The first of these games illustrates the blocking of the hanging pawns, while the last two exemplify the breaks ...e6-e5 and ...b6-b5 respectively. }

White's good piece placement rendered this move ineffective.  2. White's pair of bishops played a central role in many positions. They are very helpful in an open position such as with hanging pawns. Black seemingly underestimated the decisive d4-d5 break. It was necessary to prevent it, though passive defence would have been unpleasant as well. }

White had multiple opportunities to break up the centre with b3-b4, all of which worked well due to his well-coordinated forces.   3.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Caro-Kann Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Caro-Kann formation often appears in the Caro-Kann Defence, the Scandinavian, and the Queen's Gambit Declined  (though with the white pawn already on c4)  after White plays e3-e4 and Black captures with ...d5xe4. This pawn trade has two major consequences:   (1)  White gains better control of the centre.   (2)  White has more space by having the d-pawn on the fourth rank.  This structure gives better chances to White in most cases, as Black's pieces are constrained. For this reason, Black's main task is to dispute White's central control by modifying the structure. Now let's discuss specific plans.  White's plans  The control of the centre opens up multiple opportunities for White everywhere on the board, such as:  1. Creating a direct kingside attack. This is often accompanied by placing a knight on the e5 outpost, or targeting the weak h7-pawn with the queen and a bishop from d3.  2. Gaining space with c3-c4, h2-h4 and harmoniously placing pieces to control the centre.  3. Playing c4-c5 to restrict Black's release break ...c6-c5, and to gain control of the d6-square. If White manages to keep Black's counterplay under control, the game will be slow paced and White could even be able to combine some of these plans while Black suffers through passive defence.  Black's plans  The main objective is to dispute White's centre and transform the structure. This can be achieved by:  1. Breaking in the centre with ...c6-c5 which usually produces a black 4-2  (kingside/queenside)  versus a white 3-3 pawn structure with roughly level chances.  2. Breaking up the centre with ...e6-e5 in order to obtain a symmetrical position after White captures with dxe5. This plan is rather unlikely to succeed as many of White's pieces control e5 from their natural squares  (d4-pawn, knight on f3, rook on e1, queen on e2)  .  3. Putting pressure on the d4-pawn once c3-c4 has been played.  4. Challenging White's control of the d5-square by playing ...b7-b5 once White has played c2-c4.  As the reader may notice, all of White's plans aim for an advantage, while Black's Plans 1 and 2 are essentially aimed at equalizing. Black's Plan 3 rarely works, as White is able to defend the d4-pawn in most positions. This is why White's position is somewhat superior. It should be noted that Black's Plan 1 is the most likely to be successfully achieved.  Outposts  Some would say Black can place a knight on his d5 outpost to compensate for White placing a knight on e5; this is certainly not the case. It is unlikely that Black's knight on d5 will create serious threats to White's position. Additionally, White can always push c3-c4 to get rid of this knight if it is absolutely necessary. In contrast, White's knight on e5 is very strong, as it creates threats against Black's king. Black cannot easily expel this knight since ...f7-f6 seriously weakens the kingside.  The first three games in this chapter illustrate how White may successfully carry our his Plans 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Then follow two games which are examples of how Black may successfully carry our the ...c6-c5 break. Finally, the sixth game in the chapter illustrates Black's plan to play ...b7-b5, though White wins the game after the c6-pawn becomes a weakness. }

{ As described in the introduction, Black's main plan in the Caro-Kann structure is to achieve the ...c6-c5 break. If this is achieved, White would probably capture with dxc5 after which we would obtain the pawn structure shown in this diagram. Throughout this chapter and subsequent chapters, I will refer to this structure as the 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure simply because of the distribution of pawns. This is a relatively simple pawn structure which often offers balanced chances. }

20. h4

20... a4 21. Qc2 h5
{ It is not too late to try breaking up White's centre with  21...e5  though now White has the extra option:  22.d5 !?  Na6  23.dxc6  bxc6  24.Bh3  ± Black's position is very difficult, but this is better than being asphyxiated by White's pieces.   Instead if  21...Nf6  22.Bg5  h6  23.Bf4  ± Black does not have any useful moves, While White can slowly improve his position with  Ne5  and  Bd3  followed by potential sacrifices on  g6  or  f7. }
22. Bf4
{ Ruling out the possibility of an ...e6-e5 break, as well as taking control of the d6-square; a possible plan is Ng5-e4-d6. }
22... Rd8 23. Bd3 { The threats against Black's kingside begin to appear. }
23... Nf8
{ For example, the careless  23...Ne8  allows a potential  (but not necessary)  sacrifice:  24.Bxg6 !?  fxg6  25.Qxg6  Nf8  The only move   instead, the natural  25...Ndf6 ?  loses to  26.Ng5  Qd7  27.Rxe6  followed by  Rde1  and  Re7  26.Qxh5  Nf6  27.Qg5  ± White has a dangerous attack. }
24. Bg5 Re8
{ The rook is awkwardly placed after  24...Rd7  25.Be4  Ne8  26.Ne5 !  since  Bxe5  27.dxe5  ± leaves Black in a precarious position. }
25. a3
{ Fixing the weak a4-pawn. White's position is ideal; he has a free hand to prepare decisive action on the kingside. }
25... b5
{ Black decides to search for counterplay by fighting for the d5-square. Unfortunately for him, it is too late and this only makes White's job easier.   If  25...Nd7  White could break through the defence with  26.Ne5   or  26.Bxg6 !?  fxg6  27.Qxg6  ±  26...Nf8  27.Bf4  Rd8  28.Be4  Ne8  29.c5 !?  ± followed by  Nc4.  This plan is analyzed in the next game. }
26. Rc1 { Simple and effective - the c6-pawn is now a serious weakness. } 26...
bxc4
{ If   26...Qa6  27.Be4  Rec8  28.Ne5 !  Bxe5  29.dxe5  ± Black's kingside is worse than ever, the threat being  Bf6  followed by Qd2-h6-g7#. }
27. Qxc4 Nb5 28. Ne5 { Black's position simply collapses. } 28... Na7 29. Be3
Rd8 30. Be4
{ Black resigns as he cannot prevent the loss of pawns on c6 and a4.   Final remarks  1. White's spatial advantage played a major role throughout the game. The reader should notice how Macieja avoided trading pieces when possible, for example with 11.Nf3.   2. Black was constantly forced to calculate White's speculative threats, such as 23.Bd3 followed by a potential 24.Bxg6 sacrifice. It is possible Macieja did not even waste a minute calculating such a sacrifice, though Black was obliged to assess whether the sacrifice worked, or otherwise prevent it just to be safe.   3. Black's desperate attempt with ...b7-b5 accelerated the downfall of his position, but the loss was imminent anyway, and White had great flexibility in choosing which winning plan to implement. }

This is all true, but in this pawn structure the c4-c5 move has far more benefits than drawbacks. This move fixes the central structure, permanently banning the ...c6-c5 break and locking in Black's light-squared bishop. In addition, the d6-square becomes accessible to a knight, and clearly White's knight on d6 would be far more powerful than Black's knight on d5. Finally, White secures a stable spatial advantage, and the d4-pawn is easily defended in the current position, though it could become vulnerable if White did not proceed correctly. }

{ Final remarks  1. Throughout the entire game, White's d4-pawn was never vulnerable and the d5-square did not do much for Black, hence the c4-c5 move did not really weaken anything.   2. The move c4-c5 prevented essentially all of Black's attempts for counterplay. In particular, Black's light-squared bishop proved useless throughout the game.   3. 11...Be7 was a serious mistake, as it allowed White to seize control of the crucial d6-square, which was essential in White's victory.   4. Finally, this game serves as another example of White's positional advantage if the breaks ...c6-c5 and ...e6-e5 are impossible. Black's imprecise opening condemned him to this type of inferiority from the very beginning. }

Meanwhile, Black had a healthy kingside attack based on advancing his central majority.   2. Although White was objectively no worse until move 33, he lacked targets and his position was quite difficult on a practical level. The key to everything was White's lack of a healthy pawn majority since the passed c5-pawn was more of a weakness than a threat. }

His biggest problem was in the opening, as when he played e3-e4 he knew he could not prevent ...c6-c5 which allowed Black to equalize easily.   2. Later, White's mistake was simplifying the position unfavourably with 16.Qxd8 and 17.Nd2. It seems like White assumed the position would be just equal, but he missed the pressure his d-pawn would face. Then Van Wely imposed his positional advantage with great precision. }

{ Final remarks  1. The reader should remember how threatening the ...b7-b5 break can be. The response cxb5 is often unsatisfactory as it gives up the d5-square permanently and makes White's queenside vulnerable.   2. Allowing Black to achieve the trades ...b5xc4 and b3xc4 enables Black to gain good counterplay along the b-file.   3. For this reason, the most memorable point in this game was Zvjaginsev's idea 15.Nf5 followed by 16.Ne3 and later recapturing with Nxc4. This turned the c6-pawn into a permanent weakness while preventing Black's further breaks with ...c6-c5 or ...a6-a5. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Slav Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Slav formation could very well also be called the Queen's Gambit Accepted formation, as it originates from Black capturing ...dxc4 in a Queen's Gambit position. This structure shares many common features with the Caro-Kann structure we studied in the previous chapter. To start, Black's pawn trade ...dxc4 still results in:  1. White gaining better control of the centre.  2. White having more space by virtue of a pawn on the fourth rank. Similarly to the previous chapter, White has a comfortable advantage in this structure, and Black should hope to break free with a central break.  Specific plans can be formulated as follows:  White's plans  The control of the centre opens up multiple opportunities for White everywhere on the board. Similarly to the previous chapter, White has the plans:  1. Creating a kingside attack, this time with h2-h4-h5-h6  (or hxg6 if applicable)  and possibly e3-e4-e5.  2. Placing knights on the strong outposts e5 and c5, controlling the centre.  3. Playing e4-e5 to fix the centre and control the d6-square  (similar to c4-c5 in the previous chapter)  .  Unlike the previous chapter, White also has the possibility of:  4. Carrying out a minority attack with a2-a4 and b2-b4-b5, in order to create a weakness on the queenside.  5. Simply gaining space with b2-b4, as well as preventing the ...c6-c5 break. This is far more likely than playing f2-f4 in the Caro-Kann structure, simply because f2-f4 weakens White's king somewhat.  Black's plans  The main objective is to dispute White's centre and transform the structure. This can be achieved by:  1. Breaking in the centre with ...c6-c5, probably obtaining a symmetrical position after dxc5, or an isolani after ...c5xd4.  2. Breaking in the centre with ...e6-e5 will probably produce a 4-2 versus 3-3 pawn structure with roughly level chances.  3. Exerting pressure on the d4-pawn once e3-e4 has been played.  4. Disrupting White's centre with ...f7-f5. This is analogous to the plan ...b7-b5 in the Caro-Kann structure.  Similarly to the previous chapter, White's plans aim for an advantage, while most of Black's plans aim to equalize by transforming the structure. Black's Plan 3 rarely works, either because the d4-pawn can be easily defended, or because White players know when to refrain from e3-e4, exactly in order to prevent this plan. It should be noted that Black's Plan 2 is more likely to be achieved since White can often prevent Plan 1 by placing a rook on the open c-file.  Outposts  Black may place a knight on his d5-outpost, but this knight cannot compete with White's knights placed on the e5- and c5-squares. White can easily push e3-e4 to get rid of the knight on d5 if it is absolutely necessary. In contrast, White's knights on c5 or e5 are harder to deal with, as they are on the fifth rank, and Black cannot easily expel them. Chasing them away with ...f7-f6 and ...b7-b6 would create serious weaknesses on e6 and c6 respectively.   The first example in this chapter illustrates White's attacking chances on the kingside, while the second game is an example of White's positional advantage in an endgame in which Black loses by asphyxiation. The third and fourth games are devoted to the central breaks ...c6-c5 and ...e6-e5 respectively. The last game in the chapter is a combination of Black's Plans 3 and 4. The chapter finishes with a short fragment to exemplify White's Plan 3. }

In retrospect, it might have been objectively better to play 20.Bf4 securing a small positional edge, though practical chances should not be ignored. It is true that Black had one way to maintain equality against White’s attack; but how strong does a player need to be in order to find such a precise continuation? The strong GM Zhao was unable to defend, so I believe White’s attack is possibly the strongest continuation, at least on a practical level. }

{ Speculating on a potential e3-e4. Note how Black constantly needs to calculate how to defend against potential threats, while White can choose his moves almost randomly. A practical strategy for White is to continuously present Black with potential threats, but without carrying out any of them until the right time has come. Often White will continue to use this strategy until Black commits a serious mistake, or finds himself in time trouble, and only then will White embark on decisive action. }

{ Black resigns as the a7- and a4-pawns will soon be lost.  Final remarks  1. If Black wishes to equalize, it is absolutely necessary to find a break by either ...e6-e5 or ...c6-c5.   2. The endgame starting on move 19 was nearly lost on a practical level. The reason is that Black could not create any counterplay or find any way to equalize. Meanwhile, White could move his pieces around the entire board, speculating with multiple threats. Even Super-GMs like Mamedyarov cannot avoid decisive mistakes under such circumstances. }

{ We have reached the position of interest, and the reader should pay close attention to the differences between this game and the previous one. In the current game, two minor pieces are off the board already, decreasing Black’s space problem. In addition, the moves a2-a4 and ...a7-a5 greatly favour Black, as they give a strong square for the knight on b4 and have eliminated White’s chances to expand on the queenside in the future with the usual b2-b4. Finally, Black has a concrete plan, which is ...b7-b6, ...Ba6  (or ...Bb7)  followed by placing the rooks in the centre and pushing ...c6-c5. Unlike the previous game, White lacks pieces to prevent such liberation. For all the above reasons, the reader should understand that Black has chosen correctly when he decided to play this pawn structure. }

The main message of this game is that White cannot really hope for an advantage if he is unable to prevent a ...c6-c5 break.  2. A crucial role was played by the weakening move a2-a4 and Black’s knight on b4, which substantially limited the coordination of White’s pieces. For example, on moves 17-19 White would have liked to play Rac1, but could not due to ...Na2 winning an exchange. }

{ Final remarks  1. In the endgame, once e3-e4 has been played, the d4-pawn can become an object of attack.  2. The reader should remember that pressuring the d4-pawn will not always work. It works particularly well in this game because Black’s bishop was on g7, and because White’s pieces were poorly placed to begin with.  3. The break ...f7-f5 is an important move in Black’s strategy, undermining the control of the d5-square.  4. The idea of ...f7-f5, followed by trading pawns on e4 and playing ...e7-e5, is thematic and strategically sound, as it turns the e4-pawn into a permanent weakness. }

{ I decided to finish this chapter with a short fragment from the game Andreikin – Kramnik, Dortmund 2013.  White continued with: }
1. e5
{ Fixing the centre and preventing Black from eventually releasing his position with ...e6-e5. It should be noted that the advance e4-e5 has some crucial differences compared with the advance c4-c5 we studied in the previous chapter. Most importantly:  1. White gains direct chances for an attack since the e5-pawn controls the important f6-square.  2. Black is far more likely to achieve ...c6-c5 in this position than he was to achieve ...e6-e5 in the previous chapter.  3. In the previous chapter Black’s light-squared bishop was completely restricted. Since ...c6-c5 is not exactly impossible, Black’s bishop can find some activity from the b7-square.  4. There exists a possibility to break White’s centre with ...f7-f6 since White cannot easily play f2-f4. In contrast, in the previous chapter White could almost always respond with b2-b4 against Black’s ...b7-b6.   Similarly to the previous chapter, the d4-pawn is not really vulnerable, and Black is rather unlikely to gain anything from placing a knight on the d5-square.   If White plays  11.Bd3  Nd7  12.O-O ?   it was not too late for  12.e5 !  12...e5 !  Black equalizes completely. }
1... O-O 2. Bd3 b6
{ Black typically would attempt the break with  12...f6 ?  but here it is impossible since the g6-pawn falls after  13.Bxg6. }
3. O-O Rd8
{ If  13...Ba6  14.Qb3  Bxd3  15.Qxd3  Rd8  16.Qe4  ± White is in control, as Black cannot develop his knight. }
4. Qb3 Bb7 5. Be4 Rd7 6. Rfd1
{ This is a position to remember: White is in complete control of the game and the weakness of the backward d4-pawn is only symbolic. Black continued with 16...c5 accepting a permanently weak c-pawn, which led him to lose. The rest of the game is irrelevant to our study, but the reader should carefully examine the differences between the e4-e5 and c4-c5 advances, contrasting this chapter and the previous one. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Carlsbad Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Carlsbad, also known as the Orthodox Exchange formation, is a very well-known and thoroughly studied pawn structure. In fact, it is one of the few pawn structures which has received the attention other structures in this book deserve. The Carlsbad can be reached from many different move orders, and in some cases with reversed colours, such as in the Caro-Kann after: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5. Despite this fact, every game presented in this chapter will have White and Black playing the roles as presented in the diagram at the left.  White's plans  This position offers two main lines of attack for White:  1. Pursuing the so-called minority attack with b2-b4-b5 in order to create a queenside weakness.  2. Pushing f2-f3 and e3-e4  (or sometimes e3-e4 directly)  gaining central space and creating tension.  Given any position, it is likely that only one of these plans will work well. This will depend on how the pieces are arranged, and how Black's queenside structure is set up. For example, the character of the game can change dramatically if Black's pawns are set up as a7-b6-c7 instead of the more typical a6-b7-c6. In addition, White's queenside plan is less likely to work if the light-squared bishop has been developed on g2.  Black's plans  1. The main plan is to place a knight on e4 and to create a kingside attack, but this is not always possible. For example, White might choose a set-up in which f2-f3 is included   2. The most common auxiliary plan is to play ...b7-b6 and ...c6-c5 in order to transpose into a hanging pawns position. Or sometimes just ...c6-c5 is played directly, hence dxc5 transposes into an isolani.  3. An important though far less common plan is to play ...b7-b5 once White has played b2-b4, in order to obtain a firm outpost for a knight placed on c4. This plan is less common because ...b7-b5 also creates a weakness - a backward c6-pawn, which could cause this plan to backfire.  The first game in this chapter illustrates how necessary it is for White to place his dark-squared bishop outside the pawn chain  (say on g5 instead of d2)  . The second game is an ideal execution of White's minority attack, while the third is an example of Black neutralizing this plan after some precise moves. The fourth game in the chapter explains how White must react if Black's queenside is arranged as a7-b6-c7. The last two games show the consequences of White carrying out the e3-e4 break first successfully and then unsuccessfully. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Nicolai Getz – Simen Agdestein, Fagernes 2013@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objectives:  1. It is bad for White to have a Carlsbad structure with the dark-squared bishop inside the chain.  2. This game illustrates how Black will easily gain control of the e4-square and later develop a kingside attack. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 c6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. Bd2 O-O 8. cxd5
{ This natural-looking move is actually a serious opening imprecision that has been played more than 30 times – with poor results.   More common is  8.Bd3. }
8... exd5
{ Of course Black retakes with ...exd5 heading into a Carlsbad structure under favourable circumstances. The reader should remember the reason: White’s dark-squared bishop is inside the pawn chain and, compared to a powerful bishop on f4 or g5, it is rather useless on d2. }
9. Bd3
{ The very same Agdestein  (Black in the current game)   went for this line 20 years before, though he continued  9.O-O-O  Re8  10.Bd3  c5 !  when Black has a preferable position due to his strong initiative on the queenside, as in the game Agdestein – Shirov, Gausdal 1992. }
9... Re8 10. O-O
{ Turning the position into an isolated-queen-pawn type with  10.e4 ?  fails to  10...dxe4  11.Nxe4  Nxe4  12.Bxe4  Nf6  and White loses a piece. }
10... Qe7
{ Preventing White’s liberation with e3-e4.   Instead  10...Nf8 ?!  allows  11.e4 !  dxe4  12.Nxe4  Nxe4  13.Bxe4  with level chances in a typical isolani position. }
11. Rae1
{ Trapping the rook on f1 only makes matters worse, but there are no good suggestions for White anyway.   Attempting to develop the standard queenside plan with b2-b4-b5 is too slow, for example  11.a3  Ne4  12.b4  Ndf6  13.h3   or  13.b5  Bg4 !  when Black is already creating threats  13...Bf5  =+ when Black has comfortable control of the e4-square and good potential for a kingside attack, while White has little to say on the queenside. }
11... Ne4 { Black’s advantage is indisputable. } 12. Bc1 Ndf6 13. h3 Bd7
{ The reader should note how little White has to hope for. } 14. Nd2
{ Attempting to remove Black’s knight from e4.   It does not help to play  14.Bxe4 ?!  as it gives Black a pleasant choice between  14...Nxe4   or  14...dxe4 !?  15.Nd2  Rac8  ∓ followed by  ...c6-c5  and potentially  ...Rxc5-g5.  15.Nxe4  dxe4  16.Nd2  Qh4  ∓ threatening  ...Bxh3  with a very dangerous attack }
14... Rac8
{ A very healthy and powerful move, preparing the idea ...c6-c5 to incorporate Black’s rook into the attack.   Another option was  14...Bb8  aiming to play  15...Qd6  with threats along b8-h2, but probably Black does not want to trap his rook on  a8. }
15. a3
{ The value of Black’s 14th move is illustrated in the variation  15.Ndxe4 ?  dxe4  16.Bc4  b5  17.Bb3  c5 !  and if  18.dxc5  Rxc5  followed by  ...b5-b4  winning a piece, or  ...Rg5  with a crushing attack. }
15... Bb8
{ Preparing ...Qd6 to threaten ...Qh2#.   The try  15...c5 ?  fails to  16.Nxd5 !  Nxd5  17.Nxe4 }
16. Ndxe4
{ The decisive mistake: White underestimates Black’s attacking chances.   Preferable was  16.b4  Qd6  17.f4  Bf5  (in order to trade light-squared bishops)  18.Bb2  Nxd2  19.Qxd2  Bxd3  20.Qxd3  Ne4  21.Nxe4  Rxe4  ∓ when Black can slowly improve his position, for example with  ...f7-f5  ,  ...Rce8  and eventually  ...g7-g5. }
16... dxe4 17. Bc4 b5 18. Ba2 c5
{ Bringing the rook into the game.   Another option was:  18...Qd6 !?  19.f4   or  19.g3  Bxh3  -+  19...exf3  20.Rxf3  Qh2+  21.Kf1  Bg3  -+ There is nothing better than giving up the exchange. }
19. dxc5 Qe5 20. f4 exf3 21. Rxf3 Qh2+ 22. Kf2
{ 22.Kf1  Bc6  23.e4  Bg3  forces White to give up the exchange:  24.Rxg3  Qxg3  -+ }
22... Rxc5
{ White is simply defenceless against the multiple threats, such as ...Bc6 or ...Ne4+. }
23. Rd1 Bc6 24. e4 Nxe4+ 25. Qxe4 { 25.Nxe4  Rxc2+  and wins. } 25... Bxe4 26.
Nxe4 Rc2+ 27. Ke3 Rxe4+ 28. Kd3
{ Also hopeless is  28.Kxe4  Qe5+  29.Kd3  Qe2+  30.Kd4  Qxd1+. } 28... Rcc4
{ Final remarks  1. Having his bishop locked inside the pawn chain sentenced White to an outright inferior position.  2. White’s chances of counterplay were practically non-existent after 11...Ne4.   3. Black’s move ...Rac8 was somewhat unexpected, but very important, as the break ...c6-c5 played a crucial role in many variations.  I hope this game leaves a strong impression on the reader. White’s dark-squared bishop must be outside the pawn chain for White to have a chance in the Carlsbad structure.    Making a Caro-Kann analogy to this example, after the sequence  1.e4  c6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  cxd5  4.Bd3  Nc6  5.c3  it would be absolutely incorrect to play  5...e6 ?  as it locks the bishop inside the pawn chain, allowing White to gain a powerful attack as Black did in the previous game. }

The right moment for this reaction.  18.Nd2   It is not possible to grab the pawn with  18.Bxe4  dxe4  19.Qxe4 ?  due to  19...Bb3  winning the knight.  18...Bf5  19.Bxe4  Rxe4 !  20.Nxe4  Bxe4  21.Qd1  Qg6  22.Qf1  Black has a comfortable position, and agreed to a draw in the game Krivoshey – Klovans, Germany 1997. }
15. b4 Nb6 16. Nd2 Rad8
{ Black plays without a clear plan, and misses his chance to play the standard ...a7-a6 defensive move.   It was not too late for Black to play:  16...a6  17.a4  g6   but not  17...Nc4 ?!  18.Bxc4  dxc4  19.b5 !  += as the c4-pawn is permanently weakened  18.Rfc1 !?  += The b4-b5 break is coming sooner or later, but at least Black will only have to deal with one weakness – probably the c6-pawn – instead of two weaknesses as in the game.   It is premature to play  18.b5 ?!  axb5  19.axb5  c5 !  20.dxc5  Qxc5  when Black has enough counterplay to compensate for the isolated queen pawn, because of the open a- and c-files, as well as the c4-square for one of Black’s knights. }
17. Ne2
{ White wants to prevent Black from responding ...c6-c5 against the break b4-b5.   An interesting alternative was  17.b5  c5  18.dxc5  Qxc5  19.Nf3  Rc8  20.Rbc1  += where White enjoys a slightly favourable version of the isolani. As we studied in the game Vitiugov – Bologan from Chapter 1, the absence of Black’s dark-squared bishop deprives him of useful counterplay. Compare this to the note after Black’s 16th move, and see how in this case the a-file is now closed, limiting Black’s options. }
17... Bc8

23. Bxc6 bxc6 24. Nd3
{ This position deserves some comment. Since Black decided not to play ...a7-a6 earlier in the game, both the a2- and a7-pawns remain present. This plays a crucial role, as Black needs to worry about protecting both the a7- and c6-pawns. }

{ Final remarks  1. Black could have faced fewer problems if he had played ...a7-a6 at the right time. Then after a future b4-b5, Black would have had some chances to protect the weak c6-pawn.  2. The sequence of moves before White’s tactical blow 31.Rxc6 would not have worked so easily for White if Black did not have a weak a7-pawn. Essentially this was not a tactical mistake, but the consequence of a prior positional mistake   not playing  14...a5  , or not playing  15...a6  or  16...a6  . }

{ Now a little bit of context: this game took place during the FIDE World Cup  (a knockout event)  where players confront each other twice to decide who advances to the next round.

I thought about this for quite some time and came to agree with his decision.   The truth is that Black has arranged his pieces so well that once again  21.b5 ?  fails due to  21...axb5  22.axb5  c5 !  ∓ since the c5-pawn cannot be captured by  23.Qxc5 ?  because of  23...Qxc5  when Black wins after either  24.dxc5   or  24.Rxc5 ?

{ Aiming towards Nd3-e5 now that the e5-square lacks protection, but Black has a powerful reply.   If White instead proceeds with his b4-b5 idea with  25.Nc3  he meets the strong  25...f4 !  26.exf4  Qf6  27.Rd1  Qxf4  =+ where Black’s position is preferable due to the vulnerability of the d4-pawn.   If  25.g3  Black may just accept the challenge with  25...g5 !?  =+   or choose the alternative:  25...h5 !?  26.h4  g5  =+ }
25... f4 26. exf4 Qf6 27. Rd1 Nf5 28. Rbd3 Re4
{ White is in trouble.  Final remarks  1. What is important to take from this example is that White’s minority attack does not always work. If Black knows exactly how to react, he can perfectly well prevent the b4-b5 break.  2. In particular, playing ...a7-a6 is necessary and the idea ...Ne4-d6 covering the b5-square, should not be forgotten. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Radoslaw Wojtaszek – Ildar Khairullin, Aix-les-Bains 2011@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:   This game explains how White may proceed with a queenside attack if Black’s queenside pawns are arranged as a7-b6-c7 instead of the typical a7-b7-c6. }

exd5 9. a3 Bd6 10. b4
{ Everything is being played according to modern theory; in fact there are over 250 games with this position. One should pay close attention to Black’s pawn structure on the queenside. The most typical Carlsbad structure has pawns on a6-b7-c6-d5, which makes the b4-b5 break quite powerful. In this case, it might seem that White has little to hope for since b4-b5 does not create any weak pawns, but this is not quite the case. White’s plan is to first gain some space on the queenside with b4-b5 and a3-a4, weakening the c6-square and  'isolating” the d5-pawn, and then either play Ba3xd6 in order to weaken the c7-pawn, or blow up the centre with e3-e4. In both cases, Black’s counterplay is associated with placing a knight on e4 and then creating a kingside attack, possibly through ...f7-f5 and ...g6-g5, as illustrated in the note to Black’s 10th move. }
10... a6
{ An alternative was:  10...a5  11.b5  Nbd7  12.Bd2 ?!   instead I would have recommended  12.Qb3  followed by a3-a4 and  Ba3  trading Black’s dark-squared bishop to weaken the c7-pawn  12...Ne4  A good decision; it is crucial for Black to gain control of the e4-square, not only to prevent an eventual e3-e4 break, but also to gain attacking prospects on the kingside.  13.a4  Qe7  14.h3  f5  Reinforcing the knight on  e4  and increasing the attacking chances against White’s monarch.  15.Qc2  Ndf6  16.Rac1  Rae8  17.Ne2  g5  Black obtained a dangerous attack in Malaniuk – Annageldyev, Alushta 2007. }
11. Qb3 Qe7 12. Rb1 Nbd7 13. a4 Rfb8
{ The rook is rather useless on this square.   Preferable was:  13...Rfe8  14.b5  axb5   worse is  14...a5  15.Ra1  Rad8  16.Ba3  as trading dark-squared bishops weakens the c7-pawn:  16...h6  17.Bxd6  cxd6   or  17...Qxd6  18.Rac1  +=  18.Rac1  += when White has a pleasant position, as in Ionov – Shaposhnikov, St Petersburg 2003  15.axb5  Ne4 !

20. Qc2 Bf8 21. e4
{ ± The desired break at the right time. White gains a very powerful initiative in the centre, and Black is unable to deal with it. }

{ It was preferable to simply give up a pawn with  21...Qe7  22.exd5   or  22.e5 !?  ±  22...Qd8  23.Bc4  ± though Black still needs to be careful with tactical shots, such as d5-d6 threatening  Qxg6. }
22. Ndxe4 Bxe4
{ 22...Nxe4  is no improvement:  23.d5 !  Qe7   or  23...Bxd5  24.Nxd5  Qxd5  25.Bxe4  Qxb5  when White does not bother with  Bxa8  , but instead  26.Bxg6 !  +-  24.Nxe4  (threatening Nf6)  24...Qd8  25.Qc3  f6  26.Bc2  followed by  Qg3  with a decisive attack. }
23. Nxe4 Bg7
{ The alternative  23...Nxe4  is a nice illustration of White’s positional dominance; after  24.Bxe4  Re8  25.Re3 !  White’s advantage does not rely on a specific tactical shot, but rather on his great piece coordination, and Black’s inability to protect the back rank, as illustrated by the variation:  25...Qd6  26.Rbe1  Bg7  27.Qc4  Rf8  28.Bc2  Nf6   28...Raa8  29.Re6 !  +-  29.Bb3  Raa8  30.Re7  +- }
24. Bc4 Qf5 25. g4

25... Qf3

Qa8 41. bxc6 b5 42. Qxd5 Rxd5 43. Bxd5
{ Black resigns. The final position is quite picturesque. The strong c6-pawn, together with White’s bishops, makes the position impossible to defend, for example:  43...Qd8  44.c7  Qxc7  45.Re7+  Final remarks  1. Whenever Black arranges his pawns as in the game, with a7-b6-c7, White must carefully analyze whether he will be able to dispute Black’s control of the e4-square. If that is not the case, something is likely to go wrong.  2. If White can dispute the e4-square, then the plan b4-b5 followed by an eventual e3-e4 is very powerful, as it opens many lines for attack. Positionally, it also makes sense, as Black’s backward c7-pawn and the c6-square may become vulnerable after e3-e4, especially if light-squared bishops are traded on e4.   3. Finally, Black had nothing to hope for down the a-file or on the queenside for that matter. Hence Black’s 13th move proved to be an utter waste of time. }

The reader might think Kuzubov did not know what he was doing, as he left his dark-squared bishop inside the pawn chain. This is not the case: the dark-squared bishop can be inside the pawn chain as long as White is planning the break e3-e4 which would render this bishop useful again.  3. White’s opening did not achieve more than equality. White lost the game because after e3-e4 was played, his inaccuracies forced him into an inferior endgame. A crucial mistake was the slow 19.Kh2 steering White into passive defence. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Stonewall@@HeaderEnd@@  The Stonewall structure often arises from the Dutch Defence, the Slav or the Catalan, the first being the most common. It could also occur with reversed colours, but this is relatively rare. Of all the pawn structures we study in this book, the Stonewall has one of the worst reputations. Players from a wide range of levels would say the idea of playing ...d7-d5 together with ...f7-f5 is positionally unsound. There is partial merit to this claim, as the e5-square becomes permanently vulnerable. Whether this vulnerable square actually becomes a serious weakness often determines whether Black's position is good or not. To be honest, I myself considered the Stonewall to be a relatively bad structure until I started researching it in order to write this chapter. In fact, I originally wanted to make this chapter a manual on how to defeat this pawn structure. After a substantial amount of work, I gave up on this aim, and instead decided to accept that the Stonewall is a solid system which deserves serious consideration. I hope this chapter will be enough to convince the reader that this is the case.  Then why does the Stonewall have a bad reputation?  I believe this is the effect of two types of observational bias:  1. White's wins in the Stonewall are often visually pleasing and positionally convincing. They are likely to be used as examples in strategy books. This decision unintentionally conveys the idea that the Stonewall is positionally incorrect.  2. Black's wins are often based on tactical resources of some sort, hence they can often be considered 'accidental' rather than meritorious. Many players  (including myself before writing this chapter)  would skip chose games without further study, simply thinking: 'Black was just lucky, this will not happen to me.'  Personally, I was surprised on checking my database to realize that among IM and GM level games, White only scores about 54% with the openings presented in this chapter. This is basically a standard result, nothing special. Hence, statistically, the Stonewall is slightly inferior but no worse than many well-respected systems.  OK, that is enough defending the Stonewall, now let's discuss typical plans.  White's plans  1. Obtaining firm control of the e5-square; placing a knight on this square.  2. Trade dark-squared bishops to further weaken Black's dark squares.  3. Expand on the queenside or open the c-file at a favourable stage and pursue an invasion down this open file.  Black's plans  1. Create a kingside attack, but without completely losing control of the central squares.  2. Improve the bad bishop with the manoeuvre ...Bd7-e8-h5 or sometimes ...b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6.  3. Create central tension with ...b7-b6 followed by ...c6-c5.  Before proceeding, I would like to clarify Black's plans somewhat. First, for Black's Plan 1 to succeed, the control of the central squares is essential. If White has undisputed control of the e5-square, then most of Black's attacking attempts will fail. A healthy attack for Black will keep a balance between fighting for the e5-square and advancing on the kingside. Black's Plan 2 is important and useful, but not always necessary. Black can find a good position even with his bishop on the humble d7-square. Finally, Black's Plans 1 and 3 should certainly not be combined. The point of Plan 1 is that the Stonewall creates a solid central structure, making a flank attack feasible. The attack would probably fail if the move ...c6-c5 had already been played.  This chapter begins by showing one short example of White's dream position in the Stonewall, simply to illustrate everything Black should fight to avoid. The second and third games are examples of White's successful strategy, controlling the centre and keeping Black without counterplay. The last three games in the chapter illustrate Black's ideas for counterplay by showcasing Black's Plans 1, 2 and 3 in that order. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Sandro Mareco – Chithambaram Aravindh, Golden Sands 2013@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game fragment essentially illustrates everything that could go wrong with Black’s position, and how White may win convincingly under those circumstances.  As the reader may notice, White is doing extremely well in this game. To be thorough and comprehensive, let’s outline exactly what is good about White’s position:  1. The key e5-square is under complete control.  2. It would require about four moves for Black to remove White’s knight on e5, say with ...Rf6-f8, ...Ne8-f6-d7.   3. Black’s bishop is completely locked in by his pawns; there is no route into the game.  4. Black’s kingside pawns are not flexible. If the g4-pawn could go back to g5, then at least it would be possible to play ...f5-f4 with a semblance of counterplay.  5. There is no real chance for Black to attack along the h-file. A plan like ...Rh6, ...Qg5-h5 is far too slow and momentarily impossible due to White’s queen on d2.   6. White’s pieces are very well coordinated.  7. White has an immediate queenside break with a2-a4.   This is exactly the kind of example that strategy books use, giving the impression the Stonewall is just bad. Of course, this position is just bad, but there are many things Black could have done to avoid such a disaster. For now, let’s simply observe how White exploits his monumental advantage. }

{ +- Notice that if Black had a rook on a8 and a pawn on a5, the position would be far more difficult to win, since this move would be answered by ...b5-b4, blocking the queenside. Once the queenside is open, as in this game, Black’s situation is completely hopeless. }

9... Ne4 10. Ne2
{ This move prepares Ne5 followed by f2-f3 which will give White good control of the centre. }
10... Nd7 11. Ne5 Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bc7
{ This is the first critical moment in the game. Black’s main problem is to find a good use for the light-squared bishop. The typical ...Bd7-e8-h5 manoeuvre will not benefit Black since White simply responds with f2-f3. Hence, the only alternative is to place the bishop on the a8-h1 diagonal and advance ...c6-c5.  On the other hand, White’s objective will be to play c4-c5 obtaining a lasting advantage by restraining Black’s bishop permanently. }
13. Rc1
{ A logical move, supporting c4-c5.   Another logical alternative was  13.Qc2 !?  also supporting c4-c5, and now after  13...Bb6   better was  13...Bd7  14.Rac1  Rac8  15.c5  b6  fighting against the c5-pawn  14.Rac1  Bd7  15.c5 !  White gained a lasting advantage:  15...Bc7   15...Bxc5 ??  16.Bxe4  +-   or  15...Nxc5 ??  16.Ba3  +-  16.f3  Ng5  17.Bd4  Rfb8  18.a4  b6  19.b4  Qd8  20.Rb1  bxc5  21.Qxc5  a5  22.b5  ± Shariyazdanov – Beshukov, Biel 2002. }
13... Bd7 14. f3 Bb6
{ This move turns out to be a crucial waste of two tempos.   If  14...Ng5 ?!  then  15.c5  += restricts the light-squared bishop, and is similar to the game.   A good alternative was  14...Nc5  15.Bb1   or  15.Ba3  Bxe5  16.cxd5  Bd6  where Black is just fine;   more precise is  15.cxd5 !?  cxd5  16.Ba3  Bb6  17.Nd4  with a tiny advantage for White  15...dxc4  16.Rxc4  Na6 !  when Black equalizes after  ...c6-c5  , bringing the light-squared bishop into the game. }
15. Nd4 Ng5 { If  15...Nc5  16.Ba3  += and the pin is somewhat annoying. } 16.
Qc2 { Threatening c4-c5. } 16... a5
{ This is a rather inaccurate move, though it made no difference in the game. The reason I do not like this move will become clear in my note to White’s 19th.   If  16...c5  (preventing c4-c5)  then  17.Nxf5 !?   or the simple  17.Ne2  Rac8  18.Nf4  += when Black’s centre is somewhat vulnerable  17...exf5  18.cxd5  c4  19.Bxc4  Bxe3+  20.Kh1  when the position is rather unclear, but White’s chances are certainly preferable. }
17. c5 Bc7 18. Ne2
{ White has a lasting positional edge thanks to his spatial advantage and Black’s restricted light-squared bishop. }
18... b5 19. a3
{ This is positionally correct, but White misses a stronger continuation.   The reason I did not like  16...a5  is because after  19.cxb6 !  it is not possible to recapture ...axb6; thus after  19...Bxb6  20.Bd4  White gains control of the key c5-square, say after:  20...Rab8  21.Bc5  Bxc5  22.Qxc5  Qxc5  23.Rxc5  Nf7  24.f4  ± }
19... Nf7
{ But now that Black has played ...Nf7, the following move is logical and very strong: }
20. f4
{ Black’s knight does not have a route back to e4, hence weakening the e4-square is not a problem at all. From this point I think Black’s position is nearly lost, and the reader should pay close attention to how White manages to gradually increase his advantage without giving Black any hope of counterplay. }
20... Nh6 21. Nd4 Rab8 22. h3
{ Covering the g4-square and preparing an expansion with g2-g4. } 22... g6
{ Maybe it was better to attempt something like  22...b4  23.a4 ?!   of course it is better to play  23.Ra1 !?  ±  23...Qe8  24.Rf2  Bc8  25.g3  Ra8  26.Rg2  Ba6  trading the light-squared bishop. }
23. Rf2 Kf7 24. Nf3 Ke8 25. g3
{ Cvitan seems to be enjoying himself. He takes his time, but every move brings him one step closer to the win. Now he is preparing Rg2 and g3-g4. }
25... Kd8 26. Rg2 Kc8 27. g4 Bd8
{ Of course  27...fxg4  28.hxg4  only worsens Black’s pawn structure. } 28. Kh2
{ Again, White does not hurry to open the position yet, as there is no need to do so. Instead, Cvitan slowly arranges his pieces in optimal locations. }
28... Bc7 29. Qd2 Be8 30. Kg1 Bd7 31. Qe1 Be8 32. b4
{ This is played in order to support the c5-pawn, as White wants to use his rook on the kingside. }
32... a4
{ Having a closed queenside, the rest is just a matter of technique.   Opening the a-file with  32...axb4 ?!  33.axb4  does not exactly help Black, for example:  33...Ra8   33...Kb7  34.Bd4  Ra8  35.Bxb5 !  Opening lines for attack.  35...cxb5  36.c6+ !  Bxc6  37.Rgc2  +-  34.Ra1  Rxa1  35.Qxa1  Kb7  36.Bc3  Followed by  Ra2  with a winning attack.   It was probably better to keep the tension with  32...Ra8 !?  but after  33.Ra1 !?  threatening a3-a4, Black does not have anything better than  33...a4  , which is similar to the game. }
33. Bc3
{ +- This move is logical and very strong. It might seem premature, but after this move Black’s position is already clearly lost, for the following reasons:  1. White has a significant spatial advantage, allowing him to manoeuvre freely with his pieces.  2. Only White can open the position favourably, which he will do only once all his forces are ready for the final invasion.  3. Black’s light-squared bishop is locked in and cannot contribute to Black’s play.  4. With the last move, White shows the beginning of the winning strategy. His first step is to play Bc3-e1-h4 to make good use of his bad bishop. }
33... Kb7 34. Qe2 Bd8 35. Be1 Ka6 36. Bh4 Qc7 37. Bxd8 Qxd8
{ The first stage is complete. White has exchanged his bad bishop for Black’s good bishop; note how weak the dark squares in Black’s camp have become. }
38. Nd4 Qe7 39. gxf5
{ A strong alternative was the direct  39.Qd1 !  threatening  Qxa4  , and now  39...Ka7  40.Bxb5 !  cxb5  41.c6  gives White a winning attack, since Black’s forces lack space and coordination to defend:  41...Ka8  42.Rc5  (threatening Nxb5)  42...Rb6  43.g5  Nf7  44.Qc2  (threatening c6-c7)  44...Kb8  45.Rxb5  Rxb5  46.Nxb5  Bxc6  47.Qxc6 }
39... Nxf5 40. Bxf5 gxf5
{ The second stage is complete; White has opened the ^g-file and removed all strategic impurities from the position by trading his bishop for Black’s knight. We are left with a winning battle between White’s strong knight and Black’s useless light-squared bishop. It is impossible to prevent the invasion down the ^g-file. }
41. Kh2 Kb7 42. Rcg1 Bg6 43. Rg5
{ Progressing slowly but surely.   A more direct winning approach was:  43.Rxg6 !?  hxg6  44.Rxg6  Rg8  45.Rxe6  Qg7  46.Qf2  Rh8  (threatening ...Rxh3 followed by ...Rh8)  47.Qg2  Qxg2+  48.Kxg2  Rbg8+  49.Kh2 }
43... Rg8 44. Qf2 Rbe8 45. Qh4 Kc7
{ If  45...Qg7  preventing  46.Qh6  , then  46.R5g3  Kc7  47.Qg5  followed by h3-h4-h5 winning. }
46. Qh6 { Threatening the decisive h3-h4-h5. } 46... Qf8 47. Qxf8 Rgxf8 48. h4
Re7 49. Kh3
{ At this point pretty much every plan will win. White continues to take his time and improve his position slowly.   Another option was  49.h5  Be8  50.Rg7  Kd7  51.h6  since  51...Bg6  fails due to  52.Rxe7+  Kxe7  53.Nxc6+  Kd7  54.Nd4. }
49... Kd7 50. h5 Be8 51. Kh4 h6 52. Rg8 Ref7
{ If  52...Rxg8  53.Rxg8  Rh7  White has the nice  54.Rg6 !  Bxg6   or  54...Bf7  55.Rf6  zugzwang  !  55...Bg8  56.Rf8  Bf7  57.Ra8  +-  55.hxg6  Rh8  56.Kh5  Ke7  57.g7  Rg8  58.Kg6 !  h5  59.Nf3  followed by  Kh7  and wins. }
53. Rxf8 Rxf8 54. Rg7+ Rf7 55. Rg6 Re7 { No better is  55...Rh7  56.Rxe6. } 56.
Rxh6 Rg7 57. Rxe6 Rg4+ 58. Kh3 Rg1 59. h6
{ Final remarks  1. Black’s first mistake was allowing White to play c4-c5, which prevented ...c6-c5, hence restricting the light-squared bishop. This was essentially an opening imprecision. It was necessary to play 12...Bc5 or 14...Nc5.   2. The second mistake was to play 19...Nf7 allowing 20.f4 reinforcing White’s central dominance. This mistake was essentially decisive.  3. White’s win was slow but very convincing and a great model of how to exploit the advantage. Improving Black’s play after move 20 would provide more resistance, but probably would not change the overall result. }

A healthier alternative was  11.Ne5  f5  12.f3  Nxe5  13.dxe5  Nc5  with roughly equal chances in the game Cordova – Ordaz Valdes, Monterrey 2010. }
11... f5
{ A good decision, reinforcing the knight on e4, and going into a Stonewall-type position under favourable circumstances. The reader should note two essential characteristics in this position:  1. Black’s knight is already on e4, creating some chances for a kingside attack.  2. Black’s light-squared bishop can always become active after a timely ...dxc4 opening the a8-h1 diagonal.  For these two reasons, White should be particularly cautious, and not expect the usual solid position against the Stonewall. }
12. f3
{ A careless move based on a tactical oversight.   It was better to play  12.Nd2  though after  12...Bd6  Black has a comfortable position. }
12... Bd6
{ My favourite move in the game. This position perfectly illustrates Black’s attacking potential. White wanted to push the knight away in order to obtain a comfortable positional advantage, but Black simply leaves it there. Is it possible to take it? }
13. fxe4
{ White does not want to admit that 12.f3 was simply a weakening move, hence he accepts the challenge. Unfortunately for him, Black’s attack is even stronger than it seems.   It was better to accept the mistake and play  13.Nc3  after which Black gains the initiative with:  13...Qh4  14.f4   but not  14.g3 ?  because of  14...Nxg3 !  15.hxg3  Bxg3  when White is completely helpless against the threat of  ...Rf6-g6  , and  16.Ba3  hoping to respond to  16...Rf6  with  17.Be7  , is simply answered by  16...c5  14...Ndf6  The position is about equal, but it is Black who can fight for the advantage. }
13... fxe4 14. Bc2 Qg5
{ A very strong move, preparing ...Nf6-g4 to which White does not have a satisfactory defence despite having an extra piece. Black’s pawns on d5 and e4 are the key as they restrict the mobility of White’s forces.   It is possible that White expected  14...Qh4 ?  15.g3   but not  15.h3 ??  Qg3  followed by  ...Qh2#  15...Qh3  threatening to double rooks on the ^f-file and now  16.Qg2  Qh6  17.Qe2  Qh3  leads to a draw by repetition. }
15. Nd2

A possible continuation is:  16.Ng2  Nh5   But not  16...Ng4 ?  17.Nf4  !.  17.Rf1   17.g4  Rf3 !  and Black wins after either  18.gxh5   or  18.Nd2  Qxg4.

{ Final remarks  1. The key to Black’s successful attack was his e4-pawn, which prevented White from bringing pieces into the defence.  2. It is worth studying how Black’s attack was conducted while having control of the centre. Imagine how difficult it would have been to create threats if White had been able to place a knight on e5. }

1... f5
{ A good decision, reinforcing the knight on e4, and going into a Stonewall-type position under favourable circumstances. The reader should note two essential characteristics in this position:  1. Black’s knight is already on e4, creating some chances for a kingside attack.  2. Black’s light-squared bishop can always become active after a timely ...dxc4 opening the a8-h1 diagonal.  For these two reasons, White should be particularly cautious, and not expect the usual solid position against the Stonewall. }
2. f3
{ A careless move based on a tactical oversight.   It was better to play  12.Nd2  though after  12...Bd6  Black has a comfortable position. }
2... Bd6
{ My favourite move in the game. This position perfectly illustrates Black’s attacking potential. White wanted to push the knight away in order to obtain a comfortable positional advantage, but Black simply leaves it there. Is it possible to take it? }
3. fxe4
{ White does not want to admit that 12.f3 was simply a weakening move, hence he accepts the challenge. Unfortunately for him, Black’s attack is even stronger than it seems.   It was better to accept the mistake and play  13.Nc3  after which Black gains the initiative with:  13...Qh4  14.f4   but not  14.g3 ?  because of  14...Nxg3 !  15.hxg3  Bxg3  when White is completely helpless against the threat of  ...Rf6-g6  , and  16.Ba3  hoping to respond to  16...Rf6  with  17.Be7  , is simply answered by  16...c5  14...Ndf6  The position is about equal, but it is Black who can fight for the advantage. }
3... fxe4 4. Bc2 Qg5
{ A very strong move, preparing ...Nf6-g4 to which White does not have a satisfactory defence despite having an extra piece. Black’s pawns on d5 and e4 are the key as they restrict the mobility of White’s forces.   It is possible that White expected  14...Qh4 ?  15.g3   but not  15.h3 ??  Qg3  followed by  ...Qh2#  15...Qh3  threatening to double rooks on the ^f-file and now  16.Qg2  Qh6  17.Qe2  Qh3  leads to a draw by repetition. }

{ So far we have been following Cvitan – Doric from before. } 8. Ne5
{ This is a rare move order, though Ne5 is a standard move in general in this opening.   As we mentioned previously, a more popular choice is  8.Bb2  O-O  and now either  9.Nc3   or  9.Qc1 !?  followed by  Ba3. }
8... O-O 9. Bb2 Bd7 10. Nc3 Be8
{ The manoeuvre ...Bc8-d7-e8 is standard in this position. The light-squared bishop is of little use on c8, so Tomashevsky brings the bishop to e8 where it is ready to be activated with ...Bh5 once the right moment comes. }
11. cxd5
{ An alternative was  11.Ne2 !?  which is similar to the Cvitan – Doric game.   If  11.Qc2  Black can simply continue with:  11...Nbd7  12.cxd5   or  12.Ne2 !?  Rc8  12...exd5  13.f4   but not  13.Nxd7 ?

11... cxd5 12. Rc1 Nc6
{ The reader should note that White cannot really play for more than equality in this position. The knight on e5 is not particularly useful, and Black’s bishop on e8 is not more restricted than White’s bishop on b2. }
13. Nb5 Bb4 14. a3 Ba5 15. Be2 a6 16. Nc3 Ne4 17. b4

18... fxe4
{ Now Black has pressure down the ^f-file, with the f2-pawn being quite vulnerable. }

White gains compensation for the pawn after:  22.Rc7  Rf7  23.Rxf7  Nxf7  24.f4 !?   But  21...Rd8 !?  allows Black to keep a tiny advantage.  22.Bg4  Bd7  23.Bh5 !  This curious move is the key.  23...g6   Or  23...Re7  24.Qg4  !.  24.Be2  White is holding, since  24...Nxe5 ?  now fails to:  25.h4 !  Qf6  26.Qd4  +- }
21... Bh5
{ ∓ I find it difficult to believe that throughout the past four moves Aronian seems to have been heading in this direction voluntarily. He had a clear chance to equalize with 18.f4, and even 19.f4 was better than this position. Black’s strategy has succeeded in every way. Let’s spell out why:  1. Black does not have to worry about a weak e5-square. Instead, White has a weak e5-pawn to worry about.  2. There is pressure down the ^f-file, thanks to the strong pawn on e4.   3. Black has managed to activate his bad bishop with ...Bd7-e8-h5.   4. White’s bishop on b2 is practically useless at the moment. }
22. f3
{ Trading light-squared bishops seems quite dangerous:  22.Bxh5  Qxh5  For example:  23.Qd1   Instead, the careless  23.h3 ?  is met by the strong:  23...Rf3 !  24.Kh2   24.gxf3 ??  Qxh3+  25.Kg1  exf3  -+  24...Raf8  (threatening ...Rxh3 followed by ...Rf3 with forced mate)  25.Qd1  Rxh3+  26.gxh3  Rf3  27.Qxf3  Qxf3  -+  23...Qh4  Keeping queens on the board.

22... Qh6
{ A prophylactic move, preparing ...exf3 followed by doubling rooks on the ^f-file.   The variation  22...exf3  23.gxf3  Rf5 ?  24.f4 !  illustrates the importance of playing  22...Qh6. Now  24...Qh6  25.Qc2  and White solves most of his problems. }
23. Rce1 exf3 24. gxf3 Rf7 25. Bc1
{ No better is  25.f4  Bxe2  26.Rxe2  Ne7 !  27.Rg2  Nf5  ∓ since the bishop on  b2  is no opponent for a knight on  f5.   An alternative was  25.Qd3  but after  25...Ne7  (threatening ...Nf5)  26.e4  Qf4  ∓ White’s position is very uncomfortable. }
25... Bg6
{ There is nothing wrong with this move, but there was a more immediate win.   Black could have decided the game with the precise:  25...Nxe5 !  26.e4  Bxf3+ !  This shot was probably missed by both players   instead  26...Qf6 ?  gives away most of the advantage after  27.exd5  exd5  28.Bb2  =+  27.Bxf3  Qh3  Black goes into a winning endgame after the relatively forced line:  28.exd5  Rxf3  29.Rxf3  Nxf3  30.Bf4  Qg4  31.Rf1  Qxf4  32.Rxf3  Qc1+  33.Kg2  Qg5+  34.Rg3  Qd2+  35.Kh3  exd5  -+ }

30. Kg1 Bxf3 31. Qf2 Qg4+
{ An interesting alternative; instead of deciding the game immediately through tactical means, Tomashevsky heads into a won endgame, where he displays his positional mastery in an impeccable way.   A more tactical approach was  31...Raf8 !  32.dxe6  Qxe6  33.Qg3  Bc6  with a winning attack. }
32. Qg3 Qxg3+ 33. hxg3 Bxd5
{ The endgame is won, since White has absolutely nothing to aim for, while Black has many pawns to attack, such as a3, e5 and g3. Throughout the remaining part of the game, the reader should notice how Black’s ‘bad’ bishop is actually extremely strong, while White’s bishop is relatively useless in most variations. The position is not exactly a model of the Stonewall anymore, but it certainly deserves study as an example of endgame technique. }
34. Be3 a5 35. b5 a4
{ Disconnecting the queenside pawns. Tomashevsky knows his pawns on b7 and a4 cannot be captured, hence he will always have pawns on both flanks, which is often a prerequisite for winning. }
36. Rxf7 Kxf7 37. Rf1+ Kg6 38. Rf4 h6
{ Black can take time to improve his position before taking decisive measures. }
39. Kf2 Bb3 40. Rg4+ Kh7 41. Rd4 Rc8 42. b6 Rc2+ 43. Ke1
{ More stubborn was  43.Rd2  but after  43...Rc3  44.Bd4  Rc8 !?  I could not find a way to hold White’s position, for example:  45.Ke3  Bd5  46.Rb2  Rc1  47.Kd2   or  47.Rd2 ?  Rg1  -+  47...Ra1  48.Bc5  g5 !?  49.Rc2  Rh1  50.Rc1  Rh2+  51.Kd3  Kg6  Followed by  ...Kh5-g4. }
43... Ra2 { And now White’s position simply falls apart. } 44. Bc1
{ Instead  44.Rd7 ?  loses on the spot after:  44...Rxa3  45.Rxb7  Bd5 !  Attacking rook and bishop.  46.Bc1  Rxg3  -+ }
44... Rg2 45. Bf4 Rg1+ 46. Kd2 Ra1
{ The a3-pawn falls, and the rest is simple for Black. } 47. Kc3
{ Not  47.Rd7 ??  Rd1  +-+. } 47... Rxa3 48. Kb4 Ra1 49. Bd2
{ 49.Rd7  Bd5  -+ } 49... Bd5 50. Bc3 Ra2 51. Rd3 Kg6 52. Rd4 a3 53. Rd3 Kf5
54. Bd2 Ra1 55. Bc3 Ra2 56. Bd2 Ke4 57. Re3+ Kd4 58. Bc1 Rc2
{ Final remarks  1. The usefulness of Black’s bishop manoeuvre is best illustrated in the note to White’s 19th move. Aronian was probably dissatisfied with this position and so chose a different alternative which proved to be worse.  2. In general, the pawn structure transformations which occurred on moves 18-20 do not help White, as the e5-square becomes unavailable and particularly the e5-pawn becomes a target while Black lacks clear weaknesses. }

Black probably would not have started that plan from scratch had other plans been readily available.  2. It should be noted that it was a good decision for Black to convert the game into a Stonewall on move 12, as White did not have a clear way to execute any of her plans. The e5-square was hardly accessible and it was impossible to expand the queenside. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Grünfeld Centre@@HeaderEnd@@  The structure studied in this chapter typically arises from the Grünfeld Defence, and occasionally in the Nimzo-Indian Defence, in which case the e7-pawn will be on e6, but this does not affect the essence of the strategy. It rarely occurs with reversed colours unless White is deliberately attempting to play a Grünfeld with an extra tempo. Although there is central tension in the position presented, the most likely outcome is that pawns will be traded on d4, after which the c-file will be open, leaving White with a central pawn majority and Black with a queenside pawn majority. This will be a central theme across all positions of this type. Let's outline plans for each side:  White's plans  1. Create a central passed pawn with d4-d5, dominate the centre, gain space.  2. Create a kingside attack, which will probably include the moves h2-h4-h5 and e4-e5 to gain control of the f6-square, which is usually weakened when Black develops his bishop on g7.  Black's plans  1. Create a queenside passed pawn, especially after some simplifications.  2. Pressure the centre, place a rook on the d-file and find tactical resources associated with the open position.  In general White will get pretty good middlegame opportunities since he dominates the centre and has a little more space. This advantage disappears rather easily, as the position is open and Black has multiple opportunities to trade off pieces heading into a good endgame. One major factor in this position is the control of the c-file. If White controls the c-file it will be easier for him to expand, to create a passed pawn, to neutralize Black's play. Likewise, if Black controls the open file, White's central or kingside play will face many difficulties. One may say that open files are always important, which is often true. But in this position the open file is even more important than usual - it is essential.  The first three games in this chapter will illustrate the importance of the c-file, and through these examples, we will see how White can create a central passed pawn and win the game. In the third game, it is Black who creates pressure by controlling the c-file and eventually obtains a near-winning endgame. The last two games are devoted to the study of White attacking with the e4-e5 advance. In the first of these White's strategy proves successful, while in the second example Black manages to neutralize the threats to obtain a very superior endgame which is won with high class.  The first example in this chapter is the 17th game from the World Championship match of 1990. This game is annotated in the Mega Database by GMs Ftacnik and Gurevich. I shall fast-forward through the opening to reach the position of interest. }

{ The beginning of a mistaken plan. I somehow wanted to play safe in this game by trading several pieces early on, and hoping for an easy draw. Let’s see what happened.   A better alternative was the standard  11...e6  12.Bg5  Qc7  13.Qe3  Nd7  14.e5  with a typical Grünfeld position which has occurred in over 50 games. }

{ And here I was. After trading three minor pieces I thought my position was very close to equal, and heading for a relatively easy draw. There is great similarity between this position and the previous game, but unfortunately for me, I was unfamiliar with that game at the time, hence I was in unknown territory from a strategic perspective and I did not yet know how bad my position was.  The reader should carefully examine this position and appreciate Black’s difficulties. First, one of White’s main plans in this pawn structure is the creation of a passed pawn on the d-file, which Wesley is not very far from, since his d-pawn has already reached d5. Second, the c6-square is weakened, which probably will help White gain control of the c-file, just as in the previous game. Finally, Black’s counterplay is often based on advancing his majority on the queenside, but we know this is not going to happen soon enough; thus Black is just playing a waiting game, hoping to survive. Overall, this position is probably just a slight advantage for White, but it is extremely difficult for Black to play, as there is not a clear-cut plan, and there are many things to worry about. }
17. Rd1
{ Gaining a tempo to support the potential e4-e5 and d5-d6.   An interesting alternative is:  17.Bh6 !?  Bg7  18.Bxg7  Kxg7  19.Rbc1  Rc8  20.Rc6 !  Just as in the previous game.  20...Rxc6  21.dxc6  Qc7  22.Rc1  ± With perfect play, it is impossible to say if this is a forced win or just a draw. But White can comfortably play for a win for as long as he wants to, and should expect to score about 80% of the points, as passive defence is always difficult. As an example, I offer this variation:  22...Rd8  23.e5  e6  24.g3  Rc8  25.h4  Rd8  26.Qe3  Rc8  27.Qd4  Rd8  28.Qd6 !  Rxd6 ?   or  28...Rc8  29.Kg2  ±  29.exd6  Qxd6  30.c7  +- }
17... Bg7
{ Or  17...Be5  18.Bh6   18.f4 ?!  does not work so well after  18...Bd6  19.e5  Bc5+  20.Kh1  Qd7  followed by  ...Qf5  where Black is doing fine  18...Re8  19.Rbc1  += and again, it is similar to the previous game.   The alternative  17...Bc5 ?!  blocking the c-file can be met by  18.Bh6  Re8  19.e5  when White has good attacking prospects, aside from the potential threat of creating a central passed pawn. }
18. Ba3
{ Preparing White’s two main ideas: the creation of a passed pawn with e4-e5 and d5-d6, and the control of the c-file with Rb1-c1-c6. Black cannot prevent both. }
18... Be5
{ At this point I started to realize that I was in serious trouble, since I had lost the c-file.   In particular, I was disappointed to realize that after  18...Qd7  19.e5  Black has nothing to do other than wait, while White has a pleasant choice between the strong breaks e5-e6 and d5-d6.  19...Rfe8  20.Qe4  Rac8  21.g3 !?  (preparing f2-f4 gaining more space)  21...Rc3  22.Bb2  Rc5  23.Rbc1  Black is inferior, and must always watch out for tactical shots. For example  23...Rec8 ?  runs into:  24.e6 !  fxe6   better is  24...Qd6  ±  25.dxe6  And now  25...Qc6 ?  loses after  26.Rxc5  bxc5  27.Rd8+ !  winning the queen, or mating after  27...Bf8  28.Qe5. }
19. Rbc1 Qd7 20. Rc6
{ Following Karpov’s model, White takes control of the c-file. The machine only gives a small advantage to White, but I can testify this feels a lot worse during a live game, particularly since I did not know how to wait without further damaging my position. }
20... Rfc8 21. Qc2 e6
{ This is just a sign of desperation, damaging my own position by helping White obtain a passed pawn on the d-file.   No good is  21...Rxc6 ?  22.dxc6  Qe8  23.Rd7  when the c6-pawn and the seventh-rank invasion decide the game.   It was better to wait with  21...Rab8  but after  22.g3  Black’s position is unpleasant, facing the potential threat f2-f4 and e4-e5. A possible continuation is  22...b5  23.Bb4  Qd8  24.f4  Bg7  25.e5  ± followed by e5-e6 or d5-d6 to create a passed pawn. }
22. g3 exd5 23. exd5 h5 { My dreams were crushed too soon after the strong: }
24. Re1 { ± The bishop on e5 suddenly becomes vulnerable. } 24... Re8
{ If  24...Bg7  25.Re7  Qg4  26.d6  the passed d-pawn decides the game. } 25.
d6 Rec8 { I played this instantly as I was already under some time pressure. }
26. Rc7
{ I completely missed this nice tactical blow which gives White a decisive advantage.   I was hoping for  26.Rxc8+ ?  Rxc8  27.Qe4  Bf6  when Black’s position seems defendable, though White is still better. }
26... Rxc7 27. dxc7 Qxc7 { Not  27...Bxc7 ?  28.Re7  and White wins at once. }
28. Qe4 { Attacking the rook and the bishop. } 28... Re8 29. Bb2

29... Bxb2

{ Final remarks  1. The message of this game is very similar to the previous one. In essence, the c-file plays a crucial role in this type of structure. Without it, Black will be limited to a very difficult, passive defence.  2. Most importantly, this game illustrates the importance of studying model games for each structure, as we do in this book. Had I known the Karpov – Kasparov game beforehand, I certainly would have known how to play this position type, and I would have known what variations to avoid. }

18. e4
{ This move is a serious misjudgement, converting the game into a Grünfeld-type position under unfavourable circumstances. The reader should compare this position to the previous two games and understand why White’s move is a mistake. In these games, particularly in So – Flores, White had two strong plans in hand:   creating a passed pawn on the d-file, and controlling the c-file with his major pieces. In this position Black is well prepared to meet both plans, and it is White who does not have the time to fight for the c-file, due to the vulnerability of his central pawns.   A sound decision was  18.Rfd1  Nf6  19.Rac1  with level chances.   Or  18.c4 !?  cxd4  19.exd4  with a hanging pawns structure, although the central pawns might become vulnerable as the game is already simplified. }

The advance  19.e5 ?  gives a big advantage to Black after  19...Nd5  20.Rac1  Rac8  ∓ since there is no time for  21.Nd2 ?!

If  21.Qb3  Qb7  (threatening ...Nxe4)  22.Qd3  Qc6  Black dominates the game due to the c-file invasions  ...Qa4  and  ...Rc2  , or simply  ...Qc2.   White cannot fight for the c-file with  21.Rac1 ?  as he loses a pawn after  21...Rxc1  22.Rxc1  Nxe4.   A better defence was  21.Re2  protecting his second rank. After  21...Rc3  22.Rae1  Qd7 !?  23.Qxd7  Rxd7  =+ White has to defend an inferior endgame. }

24. Ne5 Rc7 25. d5
{ Desperation. White was probably under time pressure. Generally, attempting to create a passed pawn without controlling the position is just doomed to fail.   25.Re2  was necessary, though after  25...R2c3 !?  White’s defence requires great accuracy. For example the natural  26.Nf3 ?   Or simply waiting with  26.Kh1 ?  is refuted by  26...Qb4 !  ∓ threatening  ...Ra3  trapping White’s queen. The best defence is  26.Ree1 !  =+.  runs into  26...Rxf3 !  27.gxf3  Nh5  with a decisive attack. }

41. Kg3 b5 42. f3
{ This only makes things easier, blocking the way for White’s king.   A more stubborn defence was  42.Kf3  keeping an eye on the queenside, though after  42...a5  43.Ke2  Kd6  44.Kd2  Rd4+ !?  White’s position seems hopeless, as he cannot protect both flanks from Black’s multiple threats. }

White’s biggest mistake in this game was going into a Grünfeld structure without calculating whether he could fight for the c-file or not.  2. Black’s control of the c-file kept White under serious pressure and lacking counterplay, thus provoking the mistake 25.d5 ? which cost a pawn and the game. }

The key to this game was the timely e4-e5 advance, which gave White all the benefits but none of the drawbacks of this move.  2. The disadvantage in placing a knight on a5 is that after e4-e5 it takes many moves to reach the d5-square. By the time this knight reached d5, Black’s camp was already far too weakened. }

2... b6 3. e5
{ A good positional decision. Generally speaking, the e4-e5 advance is double-edged in the Grunfeld structure. On the positive side, it restricts the action of the g7-bishop and creates some attacking chances on the kingside. On the negative side, it may permanently weaken the d5 square, and it often gives up the possibility of creating a passed d-pawn, as Black can simply neutralize the majority with the standard ...e7-e6. This position is different, and the key is the lack of Blacks light-squared bishop and the misplacement of Blacks knight, many moves away from the d5-square. }

{ This is a critical position in the game. By advancing e4-e5, White has created some attacking prospects on the kingside, while at same time weakening the d5-square and losing the option of creating a passed pawn on the d-file. The reader should compare this position to the previous game, and realize that Black is much better prepared to meet this advance in this position, since he does have a light-squared bishop to create counterplay down the a8-h1 diagonal. Overall, chances are approximately balanced. }

23... Bxe4 24. Bxg7 Kxg7
{ There is no point in gaining a pawn with  24...Bxg2 ?!  because of  25.Bh6 !  and now it is Black who must play for a draw due to the strong threats against his king. }
25. Nxe4
{ The position has been simplified and White’s plan e4-e5 has only half worked, as Black seems to have enough resources to defend. Still, White’s chances should not be underestimated, as there are threats associated with h4-h5-h6, Qf3-f6, Nd6 etc. }
25... Nd5
{ The most precise in my opinion, keeping White’s kingside initiative under control, and playing on for the win.   25...Nxa2 !?  White forces a draw after:  26.Qf3 !   But not:  26.h5 ??  Qc1+  -+  26...Nb4  27.Nd6  Qd7  28.Qa8 !  Threatening  Ne8  winning; the only defence is:  28...Qc6 !   If  28...Nd5 ?  29.Ne8+  Kh6  30.g4  when Black is helpless against the checkmate threats.

26. Nd6
{ This is not technically a mistake, though it is heading in the wrong direction; White should not swap queens.   A healthier decision was  26.Qd2 !?  Qc4  27.h5  with approximately level chances, say after  27...h6   27...a5 ?!  28.h6+  +=  28.hxg6  fxg6  29.g3  a5  30.Nd6  Qc3  31.Qd1 =  when Black cannot easily advance his queenside majority due to potential kingside threats. White should not have trouble securing a draw. }
26... Qc3
{ The endgame after  26...Nxe3 ?!  27.Nxc8  Nc2  28.Nxa7  Nxd4  is just a draw as Black has lost his majority on the queenside, and the weak d4-pawn is off the board. }
27. Qxc3
{ Going into a very difficult endgame.   27.Qe4 !  was necessary, though Black can play for a win without risk after:  27...b5 !   another option is  27...h5 !?  , but grabbing the pawn with  27...Qa1+  28.Kh2  Qxa2  only yields a draw after  29.Qf3 !  f5  30.exf6+  Nxf6  31.Qb7+  Kh6  32.Nf7+  Kg7  33.Nd6+  with a perpetual check  For example:  28.Nxb5 ?   correct is  28.g3  with objective equality, though accuracy is required from White  28...Qc1+  29.Kh2  Qb2  30.Nd6  Qxf2  ∓ }
27... Nxc3
{ The reader should closely examine this endgame, as it reflects Black’s strategy in its pure form. The plan was to simplify the position and neutralize the kingside attack in order to go into an endgame with these characteristics. Black will obtain a remote passed pawn, probably on the a-file, while White cannot advance his extra pawn on d4. This position is an example of White’s biggest fears when playing the double-edged e4-e5. It is possible that Vovk estimated that he should be able to hold this position, but this task is actually very far from trivial as we shall see. }

{ Intending to invade the kingside. White faces a very difficult dilemma: should he race to the queenside, attempting to capture the a-pawn, and then try to return to the kingside before it is too late? Or should he wait on the kingside, risking zugzwang? }
33. g4
{ The decisive mistake, attempting to prevent the invasion, but also giving Black nice tactical resources as we will see.   If  33.Ke1  Black wins neatly with  33...Kh5  34.Kd2  Nd5  35.g3  Kg4  36.Ke2  h5  when White will fall into zugzwang after the nice sequence:  37.Nc2  Kh3  38.Kf3  Kh2  39.Ke2   39.g4 ?

White is forced to give up the f3-square:  44.Ke1  Kf3  45.Kf1  Ke4  -+   The best defence was  33.g3  g5  34.hxg5+  Kxg5  35.f3 !  attempting to create a barrier against Black’s king, though White’s position remains difficult after  35...Nd5 !?  ∓ attempting to follow up with  ...Ne7-f5  , in addition to a well-timed  ...h5-h4. }
33... Kg7
{ The position is already winning for Black, but I will not call it  ”-+” until it is a little clearer. }
34. Ke1
{ Another attempt was  34.f3  h5  35.Kg2  keeping an eye on the kingside, though after  35...Kf8 !?  Black’s king will march to the queenside decisively. For example:  36.Kf1  Ke8  37.Ke1   waiting on the kingside with  37.Kg2  only makes things easier after  37...Kd7  38.Kf2  Nd5  39.Ke2  Kc6  40.Kf2  Kb6  followed by  ...Ka5-b4  winning  37...g5 !  Winning in similar fashion to the game. }
34... h5 35. Kd2
{ If  35.gxh5  gxh5  36.Kd2  Nd5  37.Nc4  Kg6  Black wins easily after  ...Kf5-g4xh4  making the h-pawn passed.   Or  35.g5  Nd5  36.Kd2  Ne7  followed by  ...Nf5  winning. }
35... g5 { -+ A very pretty blow, creating a new passed pawn on the h-file. }
36. hxg5 h4 37. Ke1
{ If  37.Ke3  h3  38.Kf3  Ne2  then White’s king is paralyzed, and the game is lost after  ...Kg6xg5-h4  and ...Nf4; if  39.Kxe2 ?  h2. }
37... h3 38. Kf1 Kg6 39. f4 { 39.Kg1  Kxg5  40.Kh2  Kxg4  and wins. } 39... Nd5
40. Kf2 Nxf4
{ Final remarks  1. The key moment in the game was after 26...Qc3. White’s kingside play had not been completely neutralized  (there were at least chances for perpetual check)  , hence White should have kept the queens on.  2. It is possible that White did not properly evaluate the knight ending. The strength of a remote passed pawn should not be underestimated.  3. The move 28...a5 ! was very important, choosing to keep a passed a-pawn rather than a b-pawn, because the further away the pawn is from the white king, the harder it is to stop it.  4. Black’s creation of a kingside passed pawn with 35...g5 ! is a beautiful illustration of the concept of creating two fronts, which defined the game. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Najdorf Type I@@HeaderEnd@@  The structure studied in this chapter is typical of many Open Sicilians. It arises after White trades pieces on d5, and recaptures with the e-pawn. This frequently occurs in the Najdorf variation, but I should emphasize it is not limited to this variation.   For example, we can obtain this structure after the sequence  1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  Nf6  5.Nc3  e5  6.Ndb5  d6  7.Nd5  Nxd5  8.exd5.  This structure deserves careful study as the recapture exd5 dramatically changes the character of the game. Even players of the highest level transform their position with this recapture without properly assessing their chances in the resulting position. This structure provides a natural imbalance and offers interesting chances to both sides. The main plans are:  White's plans  1. Advance the queenside majority with b2-b4 and c2-c4-c5.  2. On some occasions, after Black has played ...f7-f5, it is also possible to place a bishop along the ^bl-h7 diagonal and play g2-g4 breaking up Black's structure. This plan is rare, but when it works it does so spectacularly well.  Black's plans  1. Expand on the kingside with ...f7-f5 and develop a kingside attack.  2. Restrict or undermine White's queenside expansion with a potential ...b7-b5.  Bad bishops  A recurring theme in these positions is the fight between White's light-squared bishop and Black's dark-squared bishop. Both of these bishops are considered bad according to classical strategic theory, as they run on the same colour as their respective most-advanced pawns  (on d5 for White, e5 for Black)  . As we will learn in this chapter, Black's dark-squared bishop is not bad at all, while White's bishop is often restricted and even useless in some positions. This is a rule to be remembered. General strategy books would not teach us this rule, but we should remember it as an essential strategic element in this particular structure.  The first game in this chapter is the relatively well-known game Grischuk - Zhang Zhong from 2001, in which White carries out a powerful queenside expansion to create a winning passed pawn. Later Zhang Zhong manages to create illustrative kingside counterplay which emphasizes Black's many attacking possibilities. The second game is an example of White's queenside expansion, followed by a strong kingside break with g2-g4. The third game is one from my own experience: a race between Black's kingside attack and White's passed central pawns. The last two games illustrate Black's plans in the fight between the bishops. The first of these examples is a positional treatment, while the second is a sharp tactical approach, both yielding convincing victories to Black. }

{ Final remarks  1. White’s idea of playing c5-c6 followed by b4-b5 was essential in the creation of a strong passed pawn. Other approaches would have made White’s queenside progress much slower.  2. Despite starting late, Black’s counterplay proved quite dangerous. One may wonder how things would have turned out if Black had just one extra move? }

Whereas the attempt  23...f4  , hoping to play  24...e4  , is met by  24.Bxc5 !  bxc5  25.Bc2  ± preventing  ...e5-e4  and obtaining a big advantage due to the control of the light squares and Black’s bad bishop. }
24. Bc2

{ Final remarks  1. Special attention should be played to the notes to Black’s moves 16 and 18. The essential element in trading those knights is whether Black will be able to play ...a6-a5 preventing b2-b4. If that is the case, then Black will generally do well since the queenside play loses most of its strength.  2. The bishop transfer Bd1-c2 followed by the kingside break g2-g4 is extremely powerful.  3. After analyzing this position one might be left with the impression that Black’s kingside play is not really going anywhere if White knows his way around. In the game this was true, but Black could certainly have improved his chances with the safer 14... e4 as suggested above. }

I was unsure if the knight on c6 would be useful at all, but fortunately for me, I found a tactical resource to refute Black’s plan.   An alternative was  18...Nf4  19.Bxf4  exf4  20.Kh1  ± when Black is likely to lose a pawn on the kingside, but there is some counterplay associated with the control of the dark squares.

For example  28.c5 ?   better is  28.Rg1  ±  28...Bxg3+  29.hxg3  Rxg3 !  30.Kxg3  Qg5+ =  forcing a perpetual check, since  31.Kh2 ?   31.Kf2 =  loses to  31...Rf4  with forced mate. }

{ A neat final blow. Black resigned since his pieces are overloaded in the defence of the 8th rank:  44...Qg8   or  44...Rxa6  45.Qd8+   or  44...Qxa6  45.Qd8+  45.c8=Q  Final remarks  1. A critical factor during the opening phase was whether Black would be able to exchange pieces, reducing White’s queenside potential. The comments to moves 14 and 15 deserve special attention.  2. Despite some tactical inaccuracies, Black’s kingside potential proved dangerous throughout the game.  3. The reader should remember the typical pawn sacrifice ...e5-e4 followed by ...f5-f4.   4. The most exciting moment in this game is probably when White plays Kf1-e1 giving up the exchange in order to secure his king and continue advancing his central passed pawns. }

The reader should study this position carefully, as it is essential for the understanding of the chapter. As we have studied in the previous games, White’s plan is to accomplish an expansion on the queenside with the usual b2-b4, c2-c4-c5; we know this is not going to happen in this game. Still, it is possible for White to open the queenside with c2-c3, but is this really going to help? The answer is no. There is a bigger factor hiding in the positional background and the reader should learn this once and forever. White’s biggest problem is the qualitative difference between the bishops. Although both bishops are momentarily blocked, only Black’s bishop has active prospects, either on the diagonal a1-h8, or the diagonal g1-a7.    Meanwhile, White’s bishop will be a spectator throughout the entire game. It is not uncommon for players of the white pieces  (even at the top level)  to go into this kind of position without seriously accounting for this problem, and this game is a wonderful illustration of how to convert Black’s positional advantage into a full point. }

{ Polgar does not like passive defence, and prefers to embark on a questionable attack.    More natural was  21.Rdc1  but Black can slowly improve his position:  21...Rab8  22.R3c2  a5  23.b3  a4  =+   Another option is  21.Nd2  Rab8  22.b3   but not  22.Bxa6 ?

21... a5 22. Rf3
{ The position is not well-suited for kingside operations, and Black easily neutralizes any possible threats. Nevertheless, it is difficult to suggest a better approach.   Trading knights with  22.Ne4  Nxe4  23.Qxe4  is similar to the game:  23...Rab8  24.b3   or  24.Rc2  a4  =+  24...a4  =+   A worthy alternative was  22.a4 !?  preventing Black from playing  ...a5-a4  , though after  22...Bb6  23.Rf3  Qe7  24.b3  g6  =+ Black progresses slowly with  ...Bc5  ,  ...Rab8  and later a kingside expansion with  ...f7-f5  and  ...e5-e4. }
22... Qe7 23. b3
{ This move makes it easier for Black to carry out a desirable break.   A better option was  23.Ne4  , though after  23...Nxe4  24.Qxe4  Rab8  25.Qe2  g6  =+ Black enjoys a pleasing positional edge due to his much better bishop and his chances to expand with  ...f7-f5. }

{ This is a good moment to stop and reflect upon the last few moves. Black has achieved the typical expansion ...f7-f5, placed a bishop on the strong f2-a7 diagonal, and opened the a-file, which he is now ready to invade. Meanwhile, White has accomplished absolutely nothing. I am certainly not trying to say that Judit Polgar has been completely outplayed; in fact both players have made some inaccuracies. My point is that the position after move 17 gives Black excellent prospects and very clear plans, while White does not have constructive ideas, and even the very best players would struggle to find something productive to do. }

42. Qf4 { The only defence. } 42... Qe7 43. Ra2 Re1 44. b4
{ A blunder in an extremely difficult position.   A better defence was  44.Bd3  but after  44...Kg7 !  White is running out of moves. For example, the natural sequence  45.Rc2 ?!  Qf7 !  46.Bc4 ?  loses to  46...Rg1+  47.Kh3  h6 !  followed by  ...g6-g5-g4  checkmating soon.   Or:  44.Bf1  Re4  45.Qf3  Re3  46.Qf4  Rxb3  ∓ }
44... Be3 45. Qf3
{ Also hopeless is:  45.Qh4  g5  46.Qh5  Qe4+  47.Kh3   47.Qf3  Rg1+  47...g4+  48.Kh4  Qe7+  49.Qg5+  Qxg5# }
45... Rg1+ 46. Kh3 Qg5
{ White resigned due to the threatened ...Qh6+.  Final remarks  1. White’s light-squared bishop was memorably useless in this game. The reader should never forget the tremendous imbalance between the bishops.  2. White’s biggest mistake was 17.exd5. Since Polgar was close to equality after 17.Bxd5 I would dare to assume she did not expect her position to be so bad after this structure transformation. Players of all levels fall into this strategic mistake very often, and it is something to be remembered.  3. The expansion with ...g7-g6, ...f7-f5, ...e5-e4 is standard and a strong plan if carried out with the appropriate preparation. }

The reader should study this position carefully, as it is essential for the understanding of the chapter. As we have studied in the previous games, White’s plan is to accomplish an expansion on the queenside with the usual b2-b4, c2-c4-c5; we know this is not going to happen in this game. Still, it is possible for White to open the queenside with c2-c3, but is this really going to help? The answer is no. There is a bigger factor hiding in the positional background and the reader should learn this once and forever. White’s biggest problem is the qualitative difference between the bishops.

Moreover, the bishop on b3 is restricted by its own pawns, basically doing nothing, while Black’s bishop on f6 has a strong potential to press against White’s king, say after the typical pawn sacrifice ...e5-e4 !

{ @@HeaderStart@@Najdorf Type II@@HeaderEnd@@  Just as in the previous chapter, I shall emphasize that this structure is not only typical of the Najdorf but rather many other variations in the Sicilian, such as   1.e4  c5  2.Nf3  Nc6  3.d4  cxd4  4.Nxd4  e5  5.Nb5  d6.  This structure is one of my favourites, as it provides a nice mix of tactical resources and strategic ideas. I grew up playing the English Attack against the Sicilian, and played this pawn structure many times. I enjoyed opposite flank attacks and most of my games took this direction for good or for bad. This chapter will not focus on these attacks. I will admit they are very exciting and complex, but they lack the strategic substance that constitutes the essence of this book. Instead, we will focus on the strategy that hides behind the combinations. In this structure, all strategic plans are in some way connected to the control of the d5-square. As the reader can easily verify on his own, pretty much every successful attack in this position works out because such central control has been achieved. Now, let's examine how each side may fight for the d5-square:  White's plans  1. Place a knight on d5, and have enough pieces to always be able to recapture with a piece rather than a pawn.  2. Advance g2-g4-g5 expelling Black's knight on f6, a defender of the d5-square.  3. Play Bg5xf6 to eliminate the knight defending the d5-square.  4. Play f2-f4-f5 preventing Black from placing his light-squared bishop on e6.  Black's plans  1. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5 and, by doing so, take over the initiative.  2. Press down the c-file, so that White cannot play Nc3-d5 because of a vulnerable pawn on c2.  3. Play ...b7-b5-b4 expelling White's knight from c3 before Nc3-d5 can be played.  Overall, I believe chances are approximately level. If things work out well for White, he will have pleasant control of the d5-square and he will be able to progress slowly, either positionally on the d-file, or tactically with a kingside pawn storm. On the other hand, if Black's strategy succeeds he will be able either to release his position with ...d6-d5, or favourably transfer into a Najdorf structure of Type I.  Variants of this structure  Throughout this chapter, we will consider two other versions of this pawn structure. The first consists of White having a pawn on c4 rather than c2. Roughly speaking, this permanently prevents the ...d6-d5 break, but instead gives Black the possibility to attack with ...b7-b5. The second version of this pawn structure consists of White having his f-pawn on f5 instead of f3. The main difference is that such a pawn provides better chances for a kingside attack, although the e4-pawn becomes more vulnerable.  This chapter is organized around these three variants of the structure. The first two games are examples of the standard structure with the pawns on c2 and f3. The first game illustrates White's control of the d5-square while the second is an initial example of Black's central break with ...d6-d5. The next two games showcase White's c4-pawn. In the first, White gains a dominating position from the start and easily imposes his advantage, while the second is a complicated game in which Black gains enduring counterplay by breaking White's central hold with ...b7-b5. The last two games illustrate the structure with White's pawn on f5. In the first White successfully prevents the ...d6-d5 break and slowly grinds Black down, while in the second Black does manage to break in the centre with ...d6-d5 and obtains a quick and easy win. }

{ An interesting position. White has control of the d5-square and Black’s bishop is restricted by its own pawns. However, White’s knight is currently inactive on e1, and Black has good chances for counterplay based on the c-file. Overall, the position is approximately equal, though precise play is needed from Black in order to avoid falling into a passive position after a typical c2-c3, Nc2-e3-d5 with a big advantage.   But not  18.exd5 ?  f5  =+ when Black has a superior version of the previous chapter’s structure, since White cannot expand on the queenside. }
18... f5

{ A careless move, leaving Black’s monarch alone on the kingside.   Better was  27...Rxd5  28.Nxd5  Bd8  when it is not so easy to parry Black’s attempt to equalize with  ...Bb6.  For example  29.Kg2  Bb6  30.f3  Bd4  31.Qe4  when White has only a small advantage.   An alternative was  27...Rb4  enticing White’s knight to return, but  28.Ne6 !  Rb8  29.h4 !?  leaves Black’s position rather fragile. For example:  29...a4   29...Qd7 ?  30.Rxe5  +-   or  29...Qc8 ?!  30.Rxd6 !

29... Qb4
{ Probably a miscalculation.   Safer was  29...Qc5  30.Nd5  Bd8  but after  31.h4 !?  White dominates the board thanks to his strong knight on  d5.   If  29...exf4  30.Qxe7  Qe5  31.Qxd6  Qxd6  32.Rxd6  fxg3  33.hxg3  with good winning chances. }

{ Somewhat better was:  31...exf4  32.Qxe7  fxg3  33.hxg3  Qc5 !  The best defence.   33...a4 ?!  34.Rxd6 !  (threatening Rd8 checkmating)  34...Rg8  35.bxa4  Qxa4  36.Rd8 !  Forcing the trade of rooks.  36...h6   36...Qxc2 ??  37.Rxg8+  Kxg8  38.Qe8#  37.Rxg8+  Kxg8  38.Qe6+  Kf8  39.c4  And the queen endgame is winning.  34.Qxd6  Qxd6  35.Rxd6  Black has some drawing chances. }
32. Ne6 Bf6 33. Qxb7
{ An alternative is  33.Nd8 !?  Qxf7  34.Nxf7+  Kg8  35.Nxd6  with a big advantage for White. }
33... Rxb7 34. Rxd6
{ White is a full pawn up. In addition, his knight is more useful than Black’s restricted dark-squared bishop, and the pawns on a5 and e5 are weak. Hence the advantage is nearly decisive. }
34... Kg8 35. Ra6 Rb5 36. Rc6
{ Planning to follow with Nc5-e4 with full control of the board. } 36... Be7
{ Making things worse.   Better was  36...Rd5  though White still has a huge advantage after  37.Kf1  Kf7  38.Ke2. }
37. Rc7 Kf7
{ Instead  37...Bf6  admits the loss of tempo and after  38.Kf1  White’s monarch will march to the queenside decisively. }
38. Nxg7 { +- Winning a second pawn and the game. } 38... e4 39. g4
{ Bringing the knight back into the game via f5, with a winning position. The rest is simple. }

Rxa5
{ Final remarks  1. It is often said that if White controls the d5-square and Black’s only minor piece is the dark-squared bishop, then White should be positionally winning. This statement strongly depends on how far away White’s knight is located. For example, after 18.Rd5 Black had two convincing ways to at least maintain equality since White’s knight was on e1, very far away from the d5-square.  2. Despite the objective balance, starting on move 22 the game became easier for White to play, thus giving him a practical edge. }

{ We have reached the thematic position. In contrast to the previous games, the pawns on c4 and e4 automatically secure control of the d5-square for White. Hence Black should find very concrete counterplay in order to avoid a passive position. }
8... h6
{ This is a logical move; Black wants to develop his knight without having to worry about the positional threat of Bg5xf6, but this is just too slow and this move has disappeared from top play.   Nowadays  8...b5 !  is the preferred move; it was employed for example in the game Carlsen – Anand, Sandes 2013. In the next game we will study a very similar position.

{ Final remarks  1. Black accepted an inferior position when he missed his chance to play 8...b5 to challenge White’s centre. Later he worsened his position with the weakening  (or at least useless)  11...b6.   2. Around move 16 Black should have played ...Nh5 in order to attempt ...f7-f5 or ...Bg5 to create reasonable counterplay. Instead, trading knights on d5 eliminated his chances to create any serious threats later in the game.  3. The moves 19...Bxd5 and 20...Qa8 only crystallized White’s advantage by reducing the fight down to just the protagonists of the positional imbalance. Black’s weak d6-pawn, and the qualitative difference between White’s active bishop on a3 and Black’s passive bishop on e7, reduced Black’s chances to a minimum. White won the endgame convincingly, as there was little Black could do to hold it. }

{ The structure is practically the same as in the previous game, but there are three key differences that should be noted:  1. The b-file is open for Black to create counterplay.  2. If White places a knight on d5, Black will capture ...Nxd5  (or ...Bxd5)  forcing White to occupy the d5-square with a pawn. That means White does not have full control of the d5-square. At the moment White cannot proceed with Nf1-e3-d5 since the b3-pawn is hanging.  3. White cannot easily expand on the queenside, since Black is ready to play ...a6-a5 covering the b4-square. }

Bxd5 40. Nxe5 dxe5
{ Final remarks  1. The ...b7-b5 break was essential. It creates an open file for counterplay. Later, playing ...a6-a5 was essential to prevent a queenside expansion, and to keep the b3-pawn vulnerable.  2. White did get full control of the d5-square after all, but it did not matter much because his dark squares were too weak, which gave Black enough counterplay.  3. The key to Black’s success was his ideal piece arrangement. Black’s bishop was quite useful on the g5-square, and the knight transfer ...Nf8-e6-d4 was always a strong idea. Black had so many resources for counterplay that White’s control of the d5-square made little impact and did not prevent the creation of multiple threats.  4. Overall, Black’s play was a model for how to conduct this type of position, and to prove that Black has sufficient resources for counterplay provided he opens some lines and keeps his pieces active. }

This game has two very marked phases, which could even be studied independently:  A  Between the beginning of the middlegame and up to move 27, this example illustrates how powerful White’s attacking chances are when associated with a g4-g5 break. This attack has a strong positional foundation, because White not only attacks on the kingside, but also gains a better control of d5, as Black’s f6 knight is driven away.  B  The second phase of the game starts from Black’s 27th move, which is the transition to an endgame.

{ White reaches the thematic position under very favourable circumstances. His pieces are well organized and there exist both strategic and dynamic elements in his favour. The kingside attack based on h2-h4 followed by g4-g5 is much faster than Black’s counterplay on the queenside. In addition, Black’s pieces are not well prepared to fight for the control of the key d5-square, in particular note how ineffective the bishop is on d7. This gives White chances to fight for the win positionally, either in the middlegame or in an eventual endgame. }

For example  15...Nb4  threatening  16...Nxa2  , is simply answered by  16.Rh2  protecting  c2  , possibly followed by a2-a3 and g4-g5; then  16...a5  17.a3  a4  18.Na1  Nc6  19.g5  Ng8  20.Nd5  +- when Black’s position is lost both tactically and strategically. }
15... Na5 16. h4 Bc6
{ Improving the bishop, controlling d5, and threatening 17...Bxe4.   The alternative  16...Nxb3  17.axb3   worse is  17.cxb3 ?!  b5  18.b4  a5 !  ∞  17...Bc6  18.Rh2  gives White a big advantage, due to the strong control of the d5-square and the chance of a g4-g5 break. }
17. Bd3
{ Protecting e4, and preparing the g4-g5 break.   But not  17.g5 ?  Bxe4 !  as Black is winning after  18.Nxe4  Qxc2+  19.Ka1  Nxe4.   The optimistic  17.Nxa5 ?  hoping to follow after  17...Qxa5  with  18.Bc4  , is met by  17...Bxe4 !  -+ winning material.   17.Rh2 !  was also strong, preparing  18.Nxa5  followed by g4-g5. }
17... Nd7
{ Inaccurate, allowing White to activate his light-squared bishop.   Better was:  17...Nxb3  18.cxb3 !  Now this recapture is a nice  (and standard)  choice, opening the c-file for White while maintaining control of the key d5-square. In fact, Black will generally avoid taking on  b3  , because of this recapture, but in this case the standard  18...b5 !  is better than usual, as it prevents the light-squared bishop from becoming active and, of course, it threatens  ...b5-b4  disputing the d5-square:  19.Rc1  Qb7  20.b4  += Black’s position is worse, but remains playable due to his potential activity on the queenside; for example, after a typical  ...a6-a5  break, followed by  ...b5-b4.  Unfortunately for Black, the standard liberation by  20...d5 ?  is not possible because of:  21.exd5  Nxd5  22.Nxd5  Bxd5  23.Rxc8+  +- }
18. Nxa5 Qxa5 19. Bc4
{ A standard decision; the bishop is better on b3.   White had fine attacking chances after:  19.g5 !?  b5   19...hxg5 ?  only aggravates Black’s problems after  20.hxg5  Rxh1  21.Qxh1  followed by  Qh8  with a decisive attack  20.Qg4 !?  ± Black’s position is fragile, and it is clear that his queenside attack is going nowhere. }
19... b5 20. Bb3 Qc7
{ Instead  20...b4  21.Nd5  Bxd5   21...Nc5  22.f6  +-  22.Bxd5  ± keeps Black under control. }
21. Qe2
{ An option was  21.f6 !?  but after  21...gxf6 !  there is no immediate way to continue the attack   but not  21...Bxf6 ?  22.g5  +-   White had a powerful attack after  21.g5 !  b4   or  21...Nc5  22.Nd5  Bxd5  23.Bxd5  with complete control and a powerful attack  22.Qh5 !   22.Nd5 !?  22...bxc3  23.Qxf7+  Kd8  24.Qxg7  Re8  25.f6  Bf8  26.Qg6  with more than sufficient compensation. }
21... Qb7
{ Or  21...b4  22.Nd5  Bxd5  23.Bxd5  with a big advantage for White. } 22. Bf2
{ White seems so eager to go into a superior endgame, that he completely disregards his wonderful attacking chances.   Again, the position was asking for  22.g5 !  Nc5   it is never good to capture  22...hxg5 ?  23.hxg5  Rxh1  24.Rxh1  +-  23.f6 !  ± and Black is in serious trouble. }
22... Nf6 23. Rhe1 b4 24. Nd5 Bb5
{ The alternative  24...Nxd5  25.Bxd5  Bxd5  26.Rxd5  ± is terrible for Black, as there is no counterplay and the potential g4-g5 break remains strong. }
25. Qf3
{ This imprecision is hard to understand from such a strong player. Fortunately for us, Almasi’s mistake gives us the gift of a very interesting endgame to study.   Better was  25.Nxf6+  gxf6   or  25...Bxf6  26.Qd2  Be7  27.g5  ±  26.Qd2  ± followed by  Bd5  ,  Rc1  and c2-c3 opening the queenside advantageously, since Black’s king does not have a safe place to hide. }
25... Nxd5 26. Bxd5 Qc7 27. Qb3
{ White should have kept the queens on with  27.Rd2  Bc4  28.Bxc4  Qxc4  29.Qd1 !?  followed by  Rd5.  He can slowly improve his position, maybe prepare g4-g5 or simply trade queens once conditions are favourable. }
27... Bc4
{ An endgame now comes into view and this marks the beginning of the second phase of this game. }
28. Qa4+
{ The b4-pawn is untouchable:  28.Qxb4 ??  Bxd5  29.exd5  Qxc2+  30.Ka1  Qxf2  -+ }
28... Bb5 29. Qb3 { Again:  29.Qxb4 ??  Qxc2+  30.Ka1  Qxf2  -+ } 29... Bc4 30.
Bxc4 Qxc4
{ An important moment in the game. Over the last several moves White has disregarded many good tactical opportunities in order to reach a superior endgame. Is this approach correct? In my opinion it is not. The resulting endgame, although superior for White, offers Black good chances to survive, as we will analyze. }
31. Rd5
{ The best option.   Instead  31.Qxc4 ?  Rxc4  32.Rd5  Kd7  leaves White in a position that, although preferable, contains few winning chances since a queenside expansion is impossible. }
31... Kd7
{ This move gives White an extra opportunity to keep queens on the board.    The correct reaction was:  31...Qxb3 !  32.axb3  Rc6  33.Red1  Threatening  Be1xb4.    33...h5 !   Another option was  33...O-O  34.Be1  Rb8  with reasonable chances to hold the game.   Black would like to react with  33...Kd7  34.Be1  Rb8   but  33...Kd7  is refuted by  34.Rxe5.  34.g5  f6  35.g6   Or  35.gxf6  gxf6  36.Rg1  Kf7  37.Be1  Rb8  with good chances to hold the endgame.  35...Kd7  This is the point! The e5-pawn is now immune.  36.Ra5  Rhc8  37.Rd2  Bd8  Black should have no problems drawing this endgame. }
32. Ra5
{ An interesting computer-like move was  32.Qa4+  Rc6  33.Bc5 !  when the complications seem to favour White, though it would be difficult to evaluate in a real game. }
32... Qxb3 33. axb3
{ Or  33.cxb3  Rc6  34.Rd1  Rhc8  which gives Black good defensive resources as  35.Rxe5 ?  is well met by  35...Rc2  36.Bb6  Bf6  with the initiative. }
33... Ra8
{ Losing control of the c-file, and allowing the key c2-c3 advance.   Instead  33...Rc6  34.Ra4  Rb8  makes it difficult for White to progress as c2-c3 is both necessary and very difficult to carry out:  35.Rd1  Bd8  36.Rd5  a5  when there is no trace of White’s once huge advantage. }
34. Rd1 Kc6 35. c3 bxc3 36. bxc3
{ White is getting back on track for winning the game. He will now expand with b3-b4 and c3-c4, increasing his dominance and gaining the potential breaks b4-b5 and c4-c5. The following moves are rather schematic, and many different orders would have lead to pretty much the same outcome. }
36... Kb7 37. Ra4 Rhc8
{ Trying to create counterplay is not simple. For example:  37...Rhg8  (with the idea ...g7-g6)  38.c4  Kc6  Protecting the d6-pawn   or  38...g6  39.f6 !  Bxf6  40.Rxd6  .  39.b4  g6  40.Rxa6+ !  A nice tactical blow!  40...Rxa6  41.b5+  Kb7  42.bxa6+  Kxa6  43.f6 !  +- }
38. Rb4+ Kc6 39. Kc2 Bd8 40. Ra4 Kc7 41. Rd5 Kc6 42. b4 Bc7 43. c4
{ This is probably the kind of position Almasi was aiming for when he decided to decline his tactical opportunities earlier in the game. White’s chances are very promising due to the weak pawns on a6 and d6. }
43... Rcb8
{ Slightly better was:  43...g6  44.f6   but not  44.fxg6 ?!  fxg6  as Black gains some chances of counterplay along the f-file  44...g5  45.h5  Re8  Followed by  ...Re6  , similar to the game, but with some extra moves for Black. }
44. Kc3 Kb7 45. Rd1
{ Better was:  45.Be3 !  (aimed at preventing Black’s only active plan with ...g7-g6)  45...Rg8  46.h5 !  Now White has a free hand to operate on the queenside, which he can do successfully. For example  46...f6   weak is  46...g6 ?  47.hxg6  fxg6  48.Bxh6  winning a pawn  47.Ra1  Rgd8  48.Rad1  Rac8  when White can prepare a potential c4-c5 or b4-b5 break, which should be enough to win. Play could then proceed  49.Kb3  Rb8  50.c5 !?  Kc6  51.Kc4  when Black cannot take on c5:  51...dxc5 ?  52.Bxc5  +- And White will trade rooks followed by  Bf8. }
45... Rg8 46. Be3
{ Too slow.   Better was  46.h5 !?  as in the previous note. } 46... g6
{ A good decision.   Instead  46...Kc6  47.Rda1  Kb7  48.b5  lands Black in serious trouble. }
47. f6
{ But not  47.Bxh6 ?  due to  47...gxf5  48.gxf5  Rg4  regaining the pawn with active play. }
47... g5
{ Preventing g4-g5. Now the f6-pawn will be a weakness, distracting White’s forces from queenside operations. }
48. h5
{ Worse is  48.hxg5  hxg5  when Black will bring his pieces into the game via the h-file. }
48... Rgc8
{ Somewhat better was  48...Rge8  49.Rf1  Re6  when White is tied to the defence of the f6-pawn, and it is unclear how to play for a win anymore. }
49. Rda1 Re8 50. R4a2 Bb6
{ A very unfortunate mistake, just when Black’s accurate defence was beginning to give results.   Instead  50...Re6  would have given decent chances to save the game. For example  51.b5  a5  52.b6  Bd8   of course not  52...Bxb6 ??  53.Rb2  Ra6  54.Rab1  +-  53.Rxa5  Rxa5  54.Rxa5  Rxf6  55.Ra7+  Kc6  56.Kd3  Rf3 !  threatening  ...Bxb6  or  ...Rxe3.   Even  50...a5 !?  gives good defensive chances:  51.bxa5  Ra6  White is stuck, for example  52.Rb2+  Kc6  53.Rb5  Re6. }
51. Bxb6 Kxb6 52. Ra5
{ +- Threatening the winning move b4-b5.   Of course not  52.b5 ?  a5. } 52...
Ra7
{ If  52...Re6  53.b5  Rxf6  54.Rxa6+  Rxa6  55.Rxa6+  Kb7  56.c5 !  Rf3+  57.Kc4  and the entrance of the king decides the game:  57...dxc5  58.Rxh6  +- }
53. Rd1 { Simpler was  53.b5 !  – the game reaches this position on move  55. }
53... Kc7
{ The alternative  53...Re6  does not help because of  54.Rxd6+ !  Rxd6  55.c5+  Kc6  56.cxd6  Kxd6  57.Kb3  when White can transition to a winning pawn endgame after:  57...Ra8  58.Ka3   58.b5 ?  Rb8 !  59.Rxa6+  Kc5  58...Kc6    59.b5+ !  +- }
54. Rda1
{ An alternative is  54.Rad5  Re6  55.c5 !  which is winning, because of:  55...dxc5 ?   55...Rxf6  56.Rxd6  56.Rd7+  Kb8   56...Kb6  57.bxc5+  57.Rd8+  Kb7  58.R1d7+  Kb6  59.bxc5+ }
54... Kb6 55. b5 Rea8 56. Kb4
{ The game will turn into a winning pawn endgame for White. } 56... Kb7
{ 56...axb5  57.Rxa7  Rxa7  58.Rxa7  Kxa7  59.cxb5  and wins. } 57. R1a2
{ Simpler was:  57.Rxa6 !  Rxa6  58.Rxa6  Rxa6  59.bxa6+  Kb6   59...Kxa6  60.c5  +-  60.c5+ !  dxc5+  61.Kc4  +- }
57... Kc7 58. c5
{ Black resigns, since after  58...dxc5+  59.Kxc5  Kb7  60.Rxa6  the kingside pawns will be lost.  Final remarks  1. Having a pawn on f5 together with a firm control of the d5-square gives White superb attacking chances. The attack is enhanced by having a bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal.  2. White’s play was strong, but careless through the first phase. He missed multiple near-winning options in order to transfer the game into a superior, but possibly defensible, endgame.  3. The endgame was practically very difficult for Black. In fact, Black executed all the correct ideas, but lost due to a simple miscalculation with 50...Bb6. Without this mistake, Black could have held the game for much longer, and possibly even drawn after a long and precise defence. Again, it is not easy to deal with a weak d5-square, and Black could have committed a decisive mistake later on.  4. Black faced problems due to the weak d5-square throughout the game. In order to improve upon his chances it would be necessary to correct the opening imprecisions, especially 14...e5 which converts the game into a Najdorf Type II structure where Black is not ready to fight for the d5-square. }

{ We reach the position of interest, and it is time for a comparison with the 14th move of the previous game:  1. White’s king is on the kingside. In the previous game the attack h2-h4 and g2-g4-g5 was strong and risk-free. Here, this attack is good too, but it could backfire against White’s monarch.  2. Black’s bishop on b7 is far more useful than a bishop on d7, as in the previous game; it pressures the e4-pawn and controls the d5-square.  3. White’s bishop on f3 is less useful than in the previous game; remember this bishop made it to b3, creating great attacking prospects.   Overall, this position is approximately equal, with a slight tendency to favour Black, as the ...d6-d5 break is attainable. }

After the more standard  16...Rfd8  17.Rd1  White wants to proceed with g2-g4-g5, thus Black should react soon. For example after  17...d5 !?  18.Nxd5  Bxd5  19.exd5  Bd6 !  ∞   or  19...Qxc2 !?  Black’s next move will probably be  ...Re8  , so it would have made sense to place the rook on  e8  immediately on move  16. }

In particular, the difference between Black’s bishop on b7 and White’s bishop on f3 made it easier for Black to conduct the game.  2. The idea of ...d6-d5 followed by ...e5-e4 is typical, but it is only strong after White has already played f3-f4-f5. The reader should remember this theme and remember when it works. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Hedgehog@@HeaderEnd@@  The hedgehog structure is characterized by Black's pawns on a6-b6-d6-e6, covering some central squares and preventing White's forces from approaching, like a real hedgehog does! Advancing several adjacent pawns to the 3rd rank would generally be a bad decision. For example, moving kingside pawns to h6-g6-f6-e6 would be a major positional mistake as it creates multiple weaknesses. Here this is not the case, as the natural arrangement of Black's pieces allows for the pawns to be defended rather easily, while keeping a variety of active plans at hand. White generally has a spatial advantage in the hedgehog, and Black's main plan is to break in the centre with ...d6-d5, or sometimes ...b6-b5. White will typically arrange his pieces to prevent such plans, while keeping the game tense and flexible. Now, let's discuss specific lines of action for each side.  White's plans  l. Break on the queenside with c4-c5.  2. Break on the queenside with b4-b5.  3. Break on the queenside with a4-a5.  4. Pressure the d6-pawn, but only after some pieces have been traded.  Black's plans  l. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5.  2. Break on the queenside with ...b6-b5.  3. Create a kingside attack with ...Kh8, ...Rg8 and ...g7-g5-g4. Or maybe with ...h7-h5-h4-h3.  4. Prepare all the plans above without actually executing any of them until the right opportunity comes.  White's Plans 1 -3 are often based on arranging pieces actively to subsequently open up the queenside. Such action often gives White a big advantage because Black's pieces are not as active due to their limited space. The most common of these breaks is c4-c5, which typically opens the b- and c-files. White's fourth plan is not as easy to implement because the d6-pawn is not always vulnerable. Black will usually have a bishop on e7  (or c7)  which easily protects this pawn from the attack of rooks down the d-file. In addition, the breaks ...b6-b5 and ...d6-d5 are powerful, drawing attention away from this small vulnerability. However, after some pieces are traded, Black's chances of counterplay lose strength, giving more importance to a vulnerable d6-pawn.  If White's bishop is on the f1-a6 diagonal, Black's first plan is the most important. This plan is so strong that White players will devote a great deal of energy to fight against it. In most cases, White will be able to prevent this break, and Black will need a new plan to create counterplay. A popular option is to create kingside threats with the third plan. This plan often yields double-edged positions where a single slip can be very costly for either side. As we will learn in this chapter, if White cannot fight this plan with a queenside reaction, then Black's kingside play will give him an excellent position.  If White's bishop is on g2, then the ...d6-d5 break is much more difficult to carry out, but then Black's second plan  (the ...b6-b5 break)  gains strength. As long as White does not have a bishop on the fl-a6 diagonal, this break is likely to work well. Something to notice is that if White has played g2-g3 and Bg2, then Black's plan of ...Rg8 and ...g7-g5-g4 does not really hit anything, hence it should not be attempted at all.  Finally, something to mention about Black's position is its flexibility. Often White will find ways to prevent or undermine Black's attempts for counterplay. In such cases, Black can often just wait and attempt new plans without damaging his position. In many cases it is better for Black to continue preparing his plans, or to start a new plan than to execute a plan under unfavourable circumstances; this is the essence of the fourth plan.  As the reader may have noticed from the discussion above, a key factor in the hedgehog is whether White's bishop is developed on g2 or stays on the fl -a6 diagonal. We will focus on the latter as I believe it resembles more closely the spirit of the hedgehog structure. The first four games in this chapter will illustrate White's four plans in numeric order. The fifth example will illustrate Black's ...d6-d5 break, while the remaining examples will illustrate what Black may do if this break is not possible. Games 6 and 7 are examples of the ...Rg8 and ...g7-g5-g4 plan; the eighth game is an example of the ...b6-b5 break, while the last game is a fragment illustrating Black's fourth plan - the ability to wait for an opportunity without damaging his position. }

{ The position in this diagram is from the game Kasparov - Kramnik, Botvinnik Memorial 2001. We use this diagram as a starting point to discuss the key strategic elements in this position, from White's perspective:  Piece arrangement  1. White's rooks should be placed on the b- and c-files, ready for any queenside break.  2. The queen should be placed on c1 protecting the rook on b1 from the potential X-ray attack by the queen on b8.  3. The bishop on g1 is needed against the battery ...Qb8 and ...Bc7, attacking h2.  4. The knights on d4 and d3  (or a4)  ideally support White's centre.  Possible breaks  1. White can attempt to break on the queenside with a4-a5, b4-b5 or c4-c5. Any of these would prove effective given White's ideal piece arrangement.  2. Black does not have effective central breaks. The break ...b6-b5 obviously loses a pawn, while the break ...d6-d5 is immediately punished by the typical exd5, followed by c4-c5 with a strong positional advantage. This response should be remembered and will be discussed later in the chapter. }

{ Certainly not  48.Kxg1 ??  Qe1#.   Black resigned in view of  48...Bb7  49.Rd8  Kg7  50.Rd7  winning the bishop on  b7.  Final remarks  1. The b4-b5 break should not be disregarded despite its anti-positional look. It is true that White gives up control of the c5-square and weakens his a3- and c4-pawns, but these factors did not make much of a difference in this game. On the other hand, the sudden weakness of the b6- and d6-pawns forced Black to give up a pawn.  2. After White had an extra pawn, it was still a little difficult to impose his superiority, as the a3- and c4-pawns were disconnected. Nevertheless, the plan a3-a4-a5 should work well in most cases, especially if White has a dark-squared bishop applying pressure down the g1-a7 diagonal.  3. The variation 18...d5, in which White replies with the thematic 19.exd5 followed by 20.c5, should be carefully examined. This idea presents itself many times in hedgehog positions, and deserves a close study. }

{ Although I managed to win the previous game by executing the b4-b5 break, I did not even consider it until conditions were far too favourable to ignore it. However, this break already deserves consideration in this position.  Let’s examine how the game could have continued after: }
1. b5 Bd8
{ The best defence, covering the c6-square.   Occupying the weakened c5-square with  17...Nc5 ?  actually worsens Black’s position after  18.bxa6  Nxa6   but not  18...Bxa6 ?  19.Nc6  Qb7  20.Ne7+  +-  19.Ndb5  when the d6-pawn is far too vulnerable.

Nc5   20...Nd7 ?  21.Be7  +-  21.Rd1  Rcd8  22.Bxf6  gxf6  23.Qh6  Winning the f6-pawn and the game.   Closing the position with  17...a5  does not help due to:  18.Nc6 !

The option  17...Qa8  18.bxa6  Bxa6  19.Ndb5  += is similar to the main line. }
2. bxa6 Bxa6 3. Ndb5 Ne8 4. Rb1 Nc5 5. Rcb2 { A possible continuation is: }
5... Bf6 6. Rb4 h6 7. Nd4 Nd7 8. Na4 Bd8 9. Nc2
{ Black is under severe pressure, and is bound to commit a mistake sooner or later. }
9... Rc6

10. e5
{ Transforming the pawn structure, and allowing White to convert his advantage into a more concrete form. }
10... Nxe5
{ Other moves do not help.   A waiting move, such as  26...Kh8  , is met by  27.f4 !  ± followed by  Bf3  , when both the b6- and d6-pawns are likely to fall. }

{ An imprecise move order, allowing White to quickly develop a queenside initiative.   Better was:  9...Be7 !  10.O-O   now  10.a4 ?!  is not as good since Black controls the b4-square:  10...Nc6  11.Nxc6  Bxc6  12.O-O  O-O =  10...O-O  11.Rc1  d6  White’s plan of a2-a4-a5 is now delayed since the rook is no longer on  a1. }
10. a4 { The beginning of White’s plan. } 10... Be7
{ Preventing a4-a5 with  10...a5 ?  is generally a bad idea since the weakening of the b5-square is far more serious. In this case, after  11.Ndb5  Qc6  12.Qd4  Nbd7  13.Rd1  the d6-pawn is lost. }
11. a5
{ Achieving the a4-a5 break at an early stage, thanks to Black’s imprecise opening. }

12. Qa4+ Nfd7 13. Qxa5 Qxa5 14. Rxa5 O-O 15. Kf2
{ By playing a2-a4-a5, White virtually prevents Black from carrying out his typical plans. Now that the queens are off the board, this is even more the case. So Black must defend passively and hope for a draw. }
15... Rc8 16. Rc1
{ Instead  16.Rd1 !?  deserves attention, because after b2-b4, the threats b4-b5 and c4-c5 are much stronger if White’s rooks are doubled on the d-file. For example,  16...Ne5  17.b3  Nbd7  when Black manages to hold by temporarily preventing b3-b4. }
16... Nc6
{ Making White’s plans easier.   Better was  16...Ne5 !  17.b3  Nbc6  18.Nxc6  Nxc6  19.Ra2  += though White is still better. }
17. Nxc6 Rxc6 18. b4
{ Black’s position is unpleasant. He cannot create counterplay, but must be ready to meet potential c4-c5 and b4-b5 breaks. }
18... Bh4+
{ The beginning of an incorrect plan. The bishop was best placed on e7.   It was better to play  18...Ne5 !  forcing White to clarify his intentions on the queenside. For example:  19.b5  Rcc8  20.Ra4  Kf8  21.Rca1  axb5  22.Rxa8  Rxa8  23.Rxa8+  Bxa8  24.cxb5  += White has a small advantage due to his remote passed pawn. }
19. g3 Bd8
{ A useless move, as White should bring the rook back to  a2  anyway, in order to double rooks on the d-file.  Even after a better move, Black is still struggling. For example:  19...Bf6  20.Ra2  Rb8  21.Rd2  Ne5  22.Na4 !  ± It is important for White to stay flexible, and to continue preparing either b4-b5 or c4-c5 as convenient. }
20. Ra2 Bb6
{ Bringing the king into play with  20...Kf8  does not help as after  21.Rd2  Ke7  22.Rcd1 !  Black’s position is suddenly lost due to the threats c4-c5 and b4-b5. For example:  22...Bc7  23.Na4  f6  24.c5  Bc8  25.b5 !  +-   Better was  20...Be7 !  though after  21.Rd1  ± White has a significant advantage as Black wasted too many moves to realize that the bishop belonged on  e7. }
21. Na4
{ Conceptually appropriate, but missing a major opportunity.   Much better was  21.Rd1 !  as Black cannot prevent material loss.  21...Bxe3+   or  21...Kf8  22.c5  Bc7  23.Na4  Ke7  24.Rad2  Rd8  25.b5  trapping Black’s rook  22.Kxe3  Kf8  23.c5  Ke7  24.Rad2  a5  25.Rxd6  Rxd6  26.cxd6+  Kd8  27.Rb1  axb4  28.Rxb4  ± With a healthy extra pawn. }

{ Again the only defence.   But not  26...Nxe5 ?  27.Nxc5  Rb8  28.f4  Ng6  29.Nxb7  Rxb7  30.bxa6  when the a-pawn decides the game. }

29. Nxc5 { Black’s position is now lost after the forced sequence: } 29... Rxc5
30. Rxc5 Nxc5 31. Rxc5 Ke7 32. Bb5 { This is the key. } 32... Bxb5
{ A very nice pawn endgame results after:  32...Kd6  33.Rxc6+  Rxc6  34.Bxc6  Kxc6  And Black eventually loses after:   35.Ke3  Kb6  36.Kd4  Kxa6  37.Kc5  Kb7  38.Kd6  g5 !  The game is far from over yet.  39.h4 !

33. Rxc8 Bxa6 34. Rc7+
{ The rest of this game is irrelevant to our purposes, though White won the game convincingly.  Final remarks  1. White’s early a2-a4-a5 break was very powerful, and Black should revise his poor opening sequence to avoid such an inferior position.  2. After White achieved the a4-a5 break, Black’s main problem was his lack of counterplay and the vulnerability of the a6- and d6-pawns.  3. White missed a major chance to win by not attacking the d6-pawn directly on move 21. The tactics were favourable and the game could have been decided quickly. }

[Black "The space disadvantage - and the trading of pieces"]
[Result "*"]

{ Based on the previous examples, it should be clear that White's spatial advantage plays a significant role in hedgehog positions. Most strategy books teach that we should trade pieces when we have less space. Does this mean Black should trade pieces in the hedgehog? The natural reply would be 'Yes' but reality is not as simple, and in many cases the answer is a forthright 'No'. The reason is that Black's chances of counterplay are mostly based on a ...d6-d5 break, which is unlikely to be helpful unless Black can create serious tactical threats. The trading of two, or even one minor piece, severely undermines the potential threat of a ...d6-d5 break. In other words, having traded some minor pieces would give White a more stable centre, hence a lasting positional advantage. }

Something to understand about this position is that White’s queenside plans are no longer a priority in this position, while a kingside attack is a much more suitable idea.  3. Black’s ...d6-d5 break is now nearly impossible, but as we see in this game, the ...b6-b5 break is quite likely to be accomplished. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@John Bartholomew – Timur Gareev, USA 2009@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objectives:  1. This game illustrates how Black can carry out a waiting strategy without damaging his position.  2. Black prepares many plans, and speculates with tactical ideas, but does not carry out any of them.  3. Black requires great calculating ability to carry out this strategy, as one slip can give White an overwhelming initiative, probably through a queenside attack. Both sides must constantly check the consequences of both White’s and Black’s breaks in this structure. }

{ Black’s strategy has been successful and his position is now preferable due to his strong knights on c5 and e5.  The rest of the game is irrelevant to our purposes, though eventually Black won.  Final remarks  1. This game was a test of nerves for both players. Each player attempted to carry out their plans, but found a well-prepared opponent. If Black had played 15...d5 or 23...g5, he would have reached an inferior position. In turn, White lost his patience and broke with 30.b5, which gave him a worse position.  2. This type of position requires great precision in calculation from both sides, since they must constantly check how to prevent or meet their opponent’s breaks. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Maroczy@@HeaderEnd@@  The Maroczy structure we study in this chapter bears a great similarity with the Hedgehog from the previous chapter. In fact, some sources may call that chapter's structure Maroczy as well, simply because White has placed his pawns on c4 and e4. In this book, I decided to give a separate treatment to these two structures because I consider they are sufficiently different. The difference is in how Black develops his dark-squared bishop. In the Hedgehog chapter, Black's bishop was always developed on e7, hence ...e7-e6 had been played. Here instead we study those positions where Black fianchettoes his bishop on g7. Most importantly, Black's e-pawn often remains on e7. This fact has the following consequences:  1. White can place a knight on d5, which can lead to a major structural transformation if Black trades the knight.  2. The central break ...d6-d5 is no longer a main theme here.  3. Black can trade pieces without worrying about the d6-pawn becoming vulnerable, as happened in the game Eljanov - Jakovenko from the previous chapter.  The structure we study in this chapter is typical of the Accelerated Dragon, but it can also arise as a transposition from the English Opening or some lines that start out as a King's Indian. It can also occur with reversed colours if White plays the English Opening, allowing Black to reply ...d5 and later ...c5. Most examples in this chapter will come from the Accelerated Dragon because it is the most common source of Maroczy games. Nevertheless, the ideas transfer easily to the other lines. The main theme of the Maroczy is White's spatial advantage, which means Black will often attempt to trade pieces and later fight on in the endgame phase.  White's plans  1. Gain space with a queenside expansion, place a knight on d5, and/or expand on the kingside with f2-f4.  2. After f2-f4 has been played, place rooks on the central files and break with either e4-e5 or f4-f5.  3. Place a knight on d5 and wait for Black to capture on d5. Once this happens, White can transform the structure favourably with either exd5 or cxd5. Each of these replies is studied at the beginning of this chapter.  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to alleviate the space problem.  2. Break on the queenside with ...b6-b5 and after c4xb5 and ...a6xb5 then apply pressure along the a-file.  3. Break on the kingside with ...f7-f5 and later create an attack against White's king.  4. Pressure White's queenside pawns with ...Qb6-b4, and when White plays b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3.  5. On rare occasions play ...e7-e6 and later ...d6-d5, though this plan is more typical of the Hedgehog.  Out of the plans mentioned above, it should be said that White's first three plans are more or less equally common, while Black's first three plans are the most common for him. Black's fifth plan is almost never carried out in games which originate from the Accelerated Dragon variation. }

{ Symmetric Transformation  When White places a knight on d5 and Black captures it, White's recapture changes the character of the game dramatically. The first four examples of this chapter discuss White's cxd5 recapture. The next two are examples of the recapture exd5. Then we have two examples of Black's ...f7-f5 break, one example of the ...b7-b5 break, and the chapter concludes with one example exploring White's f4-f5 and e4-e5 breaks.  This structure most typically occurs when we have a Maroczy structure and White places a knight on d5. Once Black captures this knight then White recaptures cxd5. We will call this the symmetric transformation of the Maroczy. The main theme in this structure is White's spatial advantage. As the reader will notice, there are no natural breaks in this position. Black could attempt to challenge White's centre with ...e7-e6 or ...f7-f5, but these breaks mostly weaken Black's camp and can eventually backfire. For this reason, it is easy for Black to run out of useful moves and fall into an inferior position where White expands to ultimately obtain a winning position. Now, let's discuss specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. Control the c-file and use it for a seventh rank invasion if this is possible.  2. Avoid excessive exchanges in order to make use of the spatial advantage.  3. Further expand on the queenside and kingside, squeeze Black's forces and then find a decisive break.  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to decrease the space problem.  2. Take possession of the open c-file, and if possible invade the seventh rank with ...Rc2.  3. If White has played b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3 can be useful to open another file for counterplay.  4. If the position is already simplified, and White threatens to gain space with flank expansions, then challenge White's centre with ...e7-e6 to create a distraction. This plan can backfire due to the weaknesses created, but they should not be too serious if the queens are already off the board.  As the reader will notice, White's plans of action are far more dangerous than Black's, and this is all a consequence of White's spatial advantage. Black must be careful and understand this structure can lead to a passive position. The first three examples are illustrations of White's first three plans all combined together to yield very convincing wins. In each of these three examples I will put forward suggestions to avoid losing passively in the way Black lost. Then, the fourth example is a fragment of a game to illustrate one of Black's thematic tricks to find counterplay. }

Much more common is  15.Rxc8+  Rxc8  16.g3 !  to follow up with  Bh3  , when Black loses control of the c-file.

The break  16...e6  17.dxe6  fxe6  weakens Black’s position, but secures some space and after  18.a4 ?!   instead White should play:  18.Kd3 !  Nd7  19.f4  +=  18...Kf7  19.a5  d5 !?

31... Bg7 32. Rh3 Kf8 33. h6

{ Black resigns, as there is no hope following:  41...Rxd7   or  41...Kxd7  42.Bf6  with the deadly threat  Re7  , and if  42...Kc8  then  43.Re8+  Kd7  44.Rd8#  42.Bf6+  Kc7  43.Re8  followed by  Rh8xh7  winning.  Final remarks  1. Black’s opening was rather imprecise, leading directly to an unfavourable endgame. Nowadays 12...Qxa2 is the move of choice and in fact White no longer plays 12.Nd5 because of this reply.  2. The endgame resulting after move 14 was indisputably superior for White, and the defence was very difficult in practice.  3. Black’s best approach would have been to break the powerful d5-e4 chain with a timely ...e7-e6 break. This weakens the d6- and e6-pawns, but it is the lesser of two evils. Instead, by defending passively Black was signing his own death sentence. White’s kingside expansion is a winning plan and passive defence is destined to fail no matter how precise.  4. White’s expansion on the flanks was enabled by his pair of bishops and his already existing spatial edge in the centre. By having more space, White is able to gain yet more. }

Nevertheless, almost every line required precision from Black, while White could play for a win risk-free.  4. Something to mention from the initial position is Black’s pawn on a4, which is the same colour as his bishop. If this pawn had been on a5 to begin with then Black would have had better chances to hold the game, at least in the bishop endgame. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Asymmetric Transformation@@HeaderEnd@@  Once the knight on d5 is captured, White can also recapture cxd5 to obtain a very different kind of position, which we call the asymmetric transformation of the Maroczy. Unlike the symmetric transformation, the recapture cxd5 is much more tactical and double-edged. White typically attempts a mating attack while Black will gain counterplay on the queenside. Black has a backward pawn on e7 which could become a target for White's rooks. However, Black can often neutralize this pressure by simply placing his dark-squared bishop on f6.  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack with the break f2-f4-f5 .  2. Pressure the e7-pawn by doubling rooks on the e-file. This is only likely to work if Black cannot place a bishop on f6.  Black's plans  1. Attack White's c4-d5 chain with the break ...b7-b5xc4.  2. Open the a-file with ...a7-a5-a4xb3. If White responds to ...a5-a4 with b3-b4, then the c4-d5 chain becomes weaker, and the break ...b7-b5 could be stronger.  3. Simplify the position to minimize White's attacking chances.  White's kingside attack is very effective if Black cannot create the appropriate distraction with queenside play. For this reason, it is a must for Black to have at least one queenside break at hand. In contrast, if Black realizes he will not be able to find a queenside break, then he should probably avoid this structure altogether, or find a way to swap queens before an attack develops.  If Black desires to press for a win, the best approach is to combine Plans 1-3  (or 2-3)  , when trading queens is most important. Once Black has played ...b7-b5xc4, and White recaptures b3xc4, then the c4-pawn becomes a serious longterm target. This weakness is often more serious than Black's e7-pawn which is easily defended by a bishop on f6 or a king on f8.  The next example will show us the power of White's kingside attack once Black has missed the opportunity to achieve a queenside break. Then, we will see a short fragment to illustrate the ease of Black's play in an endgame, once the c4-pawn has been weakened. }

{ Black has a clear extra pawn and won convincingly.  Final remarks  1. The reader should understand that this version of the asymmetric transformation was very bad for White from the start. The queens were off the board, White was forced to trade his dark-squared bishop, and most importantly, he could not prevent Black from breaking on the queenside.  2. Once Black captured ...bxc4, White’s recapture bxc4 was like accepting the loss, as Black obtained a dominant position and White found himself without a plan. At that point there was basically nothing to do other than wait. }

White’s post-opening play was imprecise; it was clear that Black was planning ...f7-f5 hence 16.Rfc1 was out of place.  2. The key to Black’s 17...Qe7 is to prepare ...f7-f5 so that it is not so easy for White to play f3-f4 driving away the bishop on e5, as we see in the variation 15...f5. If White cannot play f3-f4 after the trade on f5, then Black is likely to have at least enough counterplay. }

{ Black is a pawn up and won the game without problems.  Final remarks  Something that bothers me about this example  (and essentially every example I found with ...b7-b5)  is how White was still able to hold the position and even make a draw in some variations despite having allowed ...b7-b5-b4.  The truth is, this plan is often good enough to gain a tiny advantage, but the game can become oversimplified rather easily. Nevertheless, we should remember the Maroczy structure often gives better chances to White. If White has to play precisely in order to make a draw, then we could say Black’s strategy has succeeded. }

White unfortunately missed two great opportunities to play a strong f4-f5 break.  2. Black’s problem in this game was his lack of precision in critical moments. It would have helped to play ...e7-e6 to prevent White’s knight from coming to d5, where it created threats and especially allowed the f4-f5 break. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Asymmetric Benoni@@HeaderEnd@@  The asymmetric Benoni structure, usually called simply the Benoni, is a very tactical pawn structure that requires great precision from both sides. It typically arises from various Benoni openings, though it also appears in many variations of the Ruy Lopez. The main theme in this structure is the fight between pawn majorities. White has a pawn majority in the centre while Black has his majority on the queenside. The side that manages to push his majority will generally achieve a superior position, and all plans gravitate around this fact. White enjoys some spatial advantage, therefore trading pieces will often work against him. In fact, as pieces are traded, Black's position often becomes better. The reason is that Black has the potential for creating a remote passed pawn, which can be very strong in an endgame. In contrast, White's chances are at their best in a middlegame with many pieces still on the board, since the central majority often provides him with good chances for a mating attack.   Now let's spell out specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. Break in the centre with e4-e5, either to obtain an attack or to create a central passed pawn.  2. Break with e4-e5 followed by f4-f5 in order to obtain a kingside attack.  3. Break with f4-f5 followed by a kingside attack, mainly down the f-file.  4. Prevent Black's queenside expansion by playing b2-b4, blocking the advance ...b5-b4.  Black's plans  1. Advance the queenside majority with ...b7-b5, ...c5-c4, ...b5-b4, etc. Create a passed pawn if possible.  2. Pressure down the e-file, preventing White from advancing his central majority.  3. Create kingside counterplay based on ...h7-h5-h4, mainly when White has placed a knight on g3.  4. Break White's centre with ...f7-f5. This break can work wonderfully after White has played f3-f4 since the d5-pawn loses protection.  As we will see later in this chapter, Black's light-squared bishop is often the least helpful piece, as it does not contribute to the advance of the majority, and it is often blocked by the queenside pawns on a6-b5-c4. The first three games in this chapter illustrate White's Plans 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Then we use a short fragment to discuss Black's piece arrangement, and at the same time present White's Plan 4. Then the last two examples display a combination of Black's Plans 1 and 4. }

18. a5
{ This move is the standard reply against ...Rb8, since it makes ...b7-b5 lose most of its power.   The reason is that after  18...b5  19.axb6  Black no longer has a mobile pawn majority on the queenside. }
18... Qc7

19. e5
{ The desired e4-e5 break has been achieved under good conditions. Note that if White still had his dark-squared bishop pressing along h2-b8, Black’s position would just be lost. }

White’s bishop on f4 proved very useful, as it provoked Black to develop his bishop on the unnatural e7-square.  2. The central break would have been much stronger if White had not traded his dark-squared bishop.  3. Trading pieces often decreases the power of a potential e4-e5 break. For this reason Black had a great chance to equalize with the natural 17...Nb6. It often helps Black to trade off those pieces supporting the e4-e5 break.  4. After the break was achieved, Black’s position became very difficult and just one mistake was enough for it to collapse. Nevertheless, even with the best defence, White’s attack was very promising. }

Something to learn from this game is how delicate this structure is. If Black had only played the intermediate 16...h4 he would have had a somewhat superior position. Instead, the imprecise 16...b5 gave White a decisive attack.  2. White’s attacking scheme with e4-e5 followed by f4-f5 is often strong, but not always as effective as in this example. Black’s problem here was having played ...h7-h5  (weakening g6)  in addition to the white bishop’s presence on the b1-h7 diagonal, which added pressure to the g6-pawn. }

{ The position in the diagram occurred in the game Mikhalevski – Guseinov, Novi Sad 2009. Black’s pieces are arranged ideally. The bishop on g7 has a long range of action supporting the queenside expansion. Meanwhile, Black’s knights combine the tasks of preventing White’s expansion and pressuring the e4-pawn. However, the reader may notice Black’s coordination would be disrupted if he had a light-squared bishop. Where could this bishop go? As a general rule, we could say that Black’s light-squared bishop does not find a natural place in the asymmetric Benoni structure, and this position is an example of this rule. The game continued: }

32... Nxf4 { There is no defence as Black is two pawns up. } 33. Qxd6

33... Qe4
{ White resigns.   There is no satisfactory defence against the checkmate threat on g2:  34.Qd7+  Re7  35.Qg4  Ne2+  winning the queen.  Final remarks  1. The reader should notice how Black did not clarify the situation in the centre until he had played ...Na6-c7 and was ready to trade some minor pieces. These two elements are helpful in this structure, hence Black’s opening strategy proved effective in this regard.  2. One of Black’s most memorable ideas in this game is 15...b6 followed by 17...Ba6 and 19...Bc4, to obtain activity for the light-squared bishop and ultimately trade this piece and only then push the queenside majority.  3. White’s biggest mistake was the reckless 24.f4, undermining the otherwise healthy f3-e4-d5 pawn chain. Black’s 25...f5 reply was rather obvious and very strong; it is a break to remember. }

16... Bd7 17. Nf2
{ It is not a good idea to play:  17.f4 ?!  Ng4  18.Bxg4  Bxg4  19.Nf2   instead  19.f5 ?  threatening h2-h3, runs into  19...Bxf5 !  20.exf5  Rxe3  ∓  21.Qxe3 ??

{ A standard rupture in this position, claiming space on the kingside and pressing against White’s centre.   Now the usual  17...b5 ?!  does not work as well due to  18.axb5  axb5  19.Nxb5  Bxb5  20.Bxb5  Rxa1  21.Rxa1  Rb8  22.Ra5 !  when White is just in time to maintain the extra pawn. }
18. h3
{ This is probably intended to cover the g4-square, preparing the f3-f4 advance. Unfortunately for White, the weakening of the g3-square is a far more important issue.   Probably better is  18.exf5  gxf5  19.Nh3  followed by  Nf4  with a good position, due to the weakness of the h5-pawn and the e6-square. }
18... h4
{ A double-edged yet standard decision in this position. Black gains control of the g3-square, but the h4-pawn may become weak in some cases.   An alternative was  18...Nf6  19.exf5   or  19.f4  Nf7 =  19...gxf5  20.Rac1  Qa5  with level chances. }

{ Of course not:  20...b5 ?  21.axb5  +- } 21. Qc2
{ The last three moves are evidence of Black’s success with ...f7-f5. Without the possibility of expanding on the kingside, White finds himself marking time due to the lack of targets to attack. }
21... Nf6 { Slowly heading to the g3-square via h5. } 22. Bg5 Nf7
{ This is one of my favourite moves in the game, and the reader should pay close attention to it. Black has advanced with ...h7-h5-h4 gaining control of the g3-square. White reacts with the usual Bg5 intending to capture this pawn, but Black’s move presents him with a dilemma: can he really capture the pawn? }
23. Bd2
{ This natural-looking move is a serious mistake. By not accepting the challenge, White cedes the initiative and his position becomes extremely uncomfortable due to the lack of targets.   Necessary was the capture:  23.Bxh4  f4   An alternative is:  23...g5 !?  24.Bg3  f4  25.Bh2  Nh5  ∞  After the text move, Black is threatening  ...g6-g5  trapping the bishop, so now the best continuation is:  24.Nd3   If  24.Bxf6  Bxf6  Black’s control of the dark squares gives him a good position despite being a pawn down.   Or  24.Ng4 ?!  Nxg4  25.hxg4  Be5  =+ when Black obtains a dangerous attack after  ...Kg7  and  ...Rh8.  24...c4  25.Nc1  Nh5 !?  Black has good compensation for the pawn, as he can continue to advance on the queenside with  ...b7-b5-b4  , while White’s kingside attempts are currently on standby. }

The critical moment in the game was after the move 22...Nf7, and White’s biggest mistake was not to accept the challenge with 23.Bxh4.   2. Once Black gained the initiative there was little White could do to fight back. This is often the case in the Benoni structure; the position is difficult to hold once Black’s queenside majority begins its march.  3. Black’s ...f7-f5 break is often well met by exf5 followed by a knight transfer to f4  (and possibly e6)  . If White does not take advantage of Black’s vulnerable king, then he is likely to fall into a passive position, as in this game. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Symmetric Benoni@@HeaderEnd@@  The symmetric Benoni structure is one of my favourites, and it is one of the structures that motivated me to write this book. It often arises from Benoni variations in which White recaptures exd5 instead of cxd5, which yields the more typical Benoni position we studied in the previous chapter. Unlike the previous chapter in which Black had clear plans to gain counterplay, now Black faces a dilemma of what to do. Black can often develop his pieces to obtain what seems to be an equal position, but White usually retains a small spatial advantage. This advantage increases if White manages to expand on the kingside, restricting Black's pieces substantially. Black's play can be rather difficult, and great precision is required to avoid being asphyxiated. A main theme in this variation is whether Black manages to trade off some minor pieces to decrease his space problem. In addition, the control of the e4-square is often an important factor to determine whether Black can equalize or not. Let's discuss specific plans:  White's plans  1. Expand on the kingside with f2-f4, g2-g4 and potentially create an attack.  2. Attack the vulnerable d6-pawn with a bishop on the h2-b8 diagonal and a knight on e4.  3. Sometimes White will also play b2-b4, but there is really not much to be gained on the queenside. In fact, opening the queenside could give Black chances for much-needed counterplay.  Black's plans  1. Control the e4-square and occupy it with a knight.  2. Break on the queenside with ...b7-b5 , and obtain counterplay against a potentially weak d5-pawn.  3. Trade off minor pieces to decrease the space problem. Sometimes this can be achieved with the sequence ...Qb6, ...Bf5 and ...Ne4 which can also create pressure against the b2-pawn.  White's kingside expansion is the most important plan in the position, and Black's plans are aimed at fighting against it. After White plays f2-f4, Black should typically reply with ...f7-f5 to claim some space before it is too late. Later he should be ready to prevent g2-g4, as White could gain a decisive spatial advantage with this expansion. Black's Plan 2 is probably the most active and interesting reaction and should be considered in a variety of positions even in the form of a pawn sacrifice. The virtue of this sacrifice is that it opens many lines, and may ruin White's kingside expansion into a weakening.  The first game in this chapter is an older example which illustrates White's Plan 1 being executed to perfection. Then, the second game is a more modern version where Black finds a better defensive plan, though still remaining passive. The third game illustrates White's Plan 2, while White's Plan 3 is not really covered simply because it is not as important or useful. Then, the last three games in the chapter illustrate Black's Plans 1 -3 in that order. }

{ Final remarks  1. I feel amazed every time I see this game. Black was positionally crushed, and it is not even obvious what his mistake was.  2. I believe Black’s biggest mistake was choosing to play this type of structure under unfavourable conditions. In recent years, White has scored over 80% from the position after 10.Qd1; this should tell us something.  3. Black’s biggest problem was being unable to prevent White’s expansion with g2-g4. In an ideal case, Black would have had a knight on f6 and a bishop on c8 preventing such an advance.  4. After White’s 18th move g4-g5, I cannot find any good suggestions for Black. His position is bad, and his defensive task near impossible to conduct.  5. As the reader may have noticed, the opening of the kingside often turned out to favour White. This is a characteristic inherited from the structure c4-d5 vs. c5-d6: this tiny spatial advantage makes all the difference. }

{ The reader should remember that the actual game was won by Grischuk, as Malakhov chose the wrong path with 37.gxh6.  Final remarks  1. Black played much better than in the game Spassky – Fischer. The main difference was a more precise piece arrangement which prevented an early g2-g4 expansion.  2. Despite Black’s precise opening sequence, White always preserved a small plus, which becomes manifest around move 30 due to his unstoppable plan to play Nh2 followed by g3-g4 claiming some kingside space.  3. White’s mistake 37.gxh6 was a colossal positional concession. Instead, the calm 37.Qa1 would have provided excellent winning chances without any risks. }

This game is an example of how Black may carry out an effective ...b7-b5 sacrifice, in order to dispute White’s control of the game.  2. Something to note is how this sacrifice shifts the attention away from White’s positional plans. }

{ We have reached the thematic structure via a very unusual move order. } 10...
O-O
{ White does not seem to know what he is doing. He has not developed a single piece while Black has already castled. However, he has obtained a symmetric Benoni structure, which often gives White a stable centre and a lasting spatial advantage. I knew that if I allowed White to organize his pieces harmoniously, then I would be inferior despite my lead in development. }
11. Bd3 Qc7 12. Ne2 b5
{ I thought breaking on the queenside to undermine White’s coordination was my only way to avoid being squeezed as in the previous examples. I believe I was right about this evaluation. This pawn sacrifice manages to divert attention away from White’s plans due to the multiple threats.   Instead the bishop is lost after  12...Bxh2 ?  13.f4.   Natural development will lead Black into an inferior position. For example:  12...Re8 ?!  13.Nbc3  a6   Again  13...Bxh2 ?  leads to trouble, now after  14.Kf1 !  threatening f3-f4:  14...Be5  15.Nb5 !  Qb6  16.f4  Bd4  17.Nexd4  cxd4  18.b4 !  +- Followed by c4-c5 or  Bb2  with an overwhelming centre and kingside attack.  14.Bg5  Be7  15.O-O  += White is likely to take over the game as in the previous examples, most likely through a kingside expansion. }
13. cxb5
{ Accepting the challenge.   Safer was  13.Na3 !?  bxc4  14.Nxc4  Bb7  15.Nc3  Re8+  16.Kf1  with an unclear position. }
13... c4 14. Bc2 Bc5
{ The logical continuation. Black has excellent compensation due to the misplacement of White’s king and the weakened d5- and b5-pawns. }
15. Nbc3
{ This is a small inaccuracy, as it allows Black to arrange his pieces well with ...d7-d6 followed by ...Nbd7 and ...Re8.   Somewhat better was:  15.Bg5  Qe5  16.Qd2   or  16.Bxf6 ?!  Qxf6  17.Nbc3  Re8  18.Kf1  d6  when White’s position is rather delicate, for example  19.Qe1 ??  Qxf3+ !  20.gxf3  Bh3#  16...a6 !?   16...Qxb2 ??  loses to  17.Bxh7+  17.b6 !  With a dynamic balance where any result is possible, say after:  17...Nxd5 !?  18.Be4  Bb7  19.Nbc3  Nxc3  20.Bxb7  Nxe2  21.Qxe2  Qxg5  22.Bxa8  Bxb6  ∞ }
15... d6
{ Now Black is able to arrange his pieces nicely with ...Nbd7, ...Re8 and ...Bb7 with a very comfortable position. }
16. Kf1
{ The alternative  16.Bg5  is unsafe after  16...Nbd7  17.Qd2  a6 !  opening lines for a dangerous attack. For example:  18.bxa6  Bxa6  19.Be3  Qb6  20.Nd4  Rfe8  21.O-O-O  Rab8  ∓   Trading off the annoying bishop with  16.Na4  Re8  17.Nxc5  Qxc5  leads to an inferior endgame after:  18.Kf1  Nbd7  19.Qd4  Nxd5  =+ }
16... Nbd7 17. g4
{ Although White’s position is not ideal, the idea g2-g4 is still valid  (even necessary)  to claim some space on the kingside, and to connect the rooks with Kg2.   It is no better to play  17.Nd4  a6  18.bxa6  Rxa6  when g2-g4 will be needed sooner or later, as White does not have much else to do. For example,  19.Bg5 ?!  Qb6  20.Ndb5  Re8  21.Qd2  Bb7  ∓ when White lacks a constructive plan and he still has not connected his rooks. }
17... Bb7
{ A serious imprecision.   Accurate was:  17...Ne5 !  18.Kg2  a6  19.bxa6   Instead the optimistic  19.g5 ?  fails due to:  19...Qd7  20.h3   20.gxf6 ??  Qh3#  20...Nh5  21.Na4  f6 !  Bringing the rook into the attack.  22.Nxc5  dxc5  23.Nf4  fxg5 !  24.Nxh5  Nxf3  Black’s attack is irresistible.   Also the natural  19.Ng3 ?  runs into:  19...Nfxg4 !  20.fxg4  Bxg4  -+  19...Rxa6  Now Black has an excellent initiative for the pawn. White must be extra careful, for example:  20.Ng3 ?  Nfxg4 !  21.fxg4  Bxg4  22.Qd2  Bf3+  23.Kf1  f5 !  Black has a crushing attack. }
18. g5 Ne8 19. f4
{ White gains more space on the kingside, but this move is careless as it allows Black some tactical resources associated with the weakened a8-h1 diagonal.   Correct was  19.Kg2 !  a6   19...Nb6 ?  is bad due to  20.a4 !  ± followed by a4-a5-a6  20.bxa6  Rxa6  ∞ when chances are approximately level. }
19... Nb6 { Black’s plan is to create pressure on the d5-pawn. } 20. Be4
{ Logical, but inaccurate.   Better was  20.Ng3  since now  20...Qd7  is met by  21.Bf5  with an unclear game.   Instead  20.Ng3  a6 !?  allows Black to retain his initiative, say after  21.bxa6  Rxa6  22.Be4  Qd7  23.Kg2  f5 !  24.Bf3  Nc7  =+ when the d5-pawn is likely to be lost. }
20... Qd7 21. Kg2
{ During the game I was happy to realize that  21.a4 ?!  with the idea of a4-a5-a6 suppressing Black’s counterplay, fails tactically to:  21...Nc7  22.a5 ?  Nbxd5 !  The weakening of the long diagonal now becomes evident.  23.Nxd5  Nxd5  24.Bxd5  Qh3+ !  The key move.  25.Ke1  Qh4+  26.Ng3   26.Kf1 ??  Qf2#  26...Rfe8+  27.Kd2   27.Kf1 ??  Qh3+  28.Bg2  Bxg2#  27...Bxd5  And Black is winning. }
21... Nc7
{ ∓ It becomes clear that the ...b7-b5 sacrifice has paid off, since the d5-pawn and the a8-h1 diagonal are very weak. Most importantly, White has been unable to arrange his pieces in harmony, as he achieved in the previous examples. }
22. Ng3
{ It is just too late for  22.a4 ?!  due to  22...Rae8 !  23.a5 ?  Nbxd5 !  when everything falls apart. For example:  24.Bxd5  Qg4+  25.Ng3  Nxd5 !  26.Qxg4  Nxf4+  27.Kf1  Bg2# }
22... Rfe8
{ With the idea of a potential ...Rxe4 followed by ...Nbxd5 with a strong initiative.   Even stronger was  22...Rae8 !  ∓ with the additional option of  ...f7-f6  opening the f-file. }
23. Bf3
{ 23.Re1 ?  does not help:  23...Nbxd5 !  -+   Or  23.Rf1  Nxb5  24.Nxb5  Qxb5  , when the threat of  ...Rxe4  remains strong. For example,  25.Qf3  Rxe4  26.Nxe4  Bxd5  followed by  ...Qc6  and  ...Re8  winning.   An alternative was:  23.Qf3  Nxb5  ∓ }
23... Nxb5
{ I completely missed  23...Bb4 !  followed by  ...Bxc3  and  ...Nbxd5  , which is simply winning. }
24. Nxb5 Qxb5 25. a4 Qa5 26. Bd2
{ If  26.Nf5 !?  then Black breaks through White’s position with:  26...c3 !  ∓ }
26... Qa6 27. Bc3
{ A calculation error in time trouble.   Defending the d5-pawn with  27.Bc1 ?!  does not help because of  27...c3 !  28.bxc3  Qc4  followed by  ...Bxd5  with a strong attack.   Accurate was  27.b4 !  cxb3  28.Qxb3  Qc4  29.Qxc4  Nxc4  =+ when Black is better, though White has some chances to hold the game. }
27... Re3 28. Re1 Nxd5
{ -+   The key to  28...Nxd5  is that after  29.Bxd5  Rd3  Black regains the piece with a crushing attack. Black is winning, but the game was eventually drawn as White found good resources in mutual time pressure.  Final remarks  1. White’s opening deserves careful examination. If Black had not chosen 8...b5, he would have been left without active plans, and his development lead would have been worthless.  2. Black’s ...b7-b5 pawn sacrifice was effective because the d5-pawn immediately became a target and because White’s king became vulnerable. Without these factors this sacrifice could have been a failure.  3. It is worth noticing how White never really managed to organize his forces towards anything other than protecting his weaknesses. And everything Black achieved was at the sole cost of a pawn! This means the ...b7-b5 sacrifice is often well justified as long as Black can seize immediate counterplay. }

{ As a King’s Indian player I faced this pawn structure rather frequently, and I often got into trouble due to White’s kingside expansion. Later, I learned this plan in order to capture the b2-pawn, but to my surprise even those positions posed some problems for Black, and this game is an example. Then the question is: Why does this happen? The reason is that in most variations, the weakness of the d6- and b7-pawns is far more important than losing the b2-pawn, and the well-advanced d5-pawn turns the balance in White’s favour in most cases.   If  13...Bxb2 ?  14.Rd1  Bf5  15.Nxf5  gxf5  16.O-O  ± Black is a pawn up, but his kingside is in serious danger.

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Type I@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure most commonly appears in the King's Indian, the Queen's Indian and the Ruy Lopez. In my own games, I often encountered this structure with Black, and I lost many games without really understanding why. For this reason, when writing this book I considered this structure to be one of my main interests and I decided it deserves a separate chapter from other King's Indian positions, as the character of the game is somewhat different.   The difference between this structure and those in the following two chapters is the open c-file. This file plays a major role and Black's ability to stay in the game will depend on whether he knows what to do with it. The questions are:  A  Should Black proceed with a kingside attack regardless of the open c-file?  B  Should he fight for the control of this file?  The problem with Strategy A is that White's forces may penetrate down the c-file, distracting Black from a kingside attack. For example, if White were to place a rook on the seventh rank, it would be difficult for Black's kingside play to continue making progress.  The problem with Strategy B is that White's spatial advantage often guarantees control of the c-file in the long run. White has more space thanks to his central chain e4-d5. If the position is not too simplified then this space translates into being able to manoeuvre more easily. In such cases, although Black may control the c-file at an early stage, it will be White who will ultimately profit from it, or from queenside play in general. This is not to say Black's queenside attempts are always doomed, but the reader should understand that Black's spatial disadvantage and White's lack of weaknesses will make it difficult for Black to gain an advantage from queenside play alone.  Despite these difficulties, I believe approaches A and B are both valid given the right circumstances. Ideally, they could even be combined, though this is hard to accomplish in practice. Now, let's discuss specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. If Black controls the c-file, the main task is to cover Black's entry points  (especially c2)  , and then manoeuvre to fight for the control of this file.  2. If White possesses the c-file, then prepare a seventh-rank invasion which is likely to capture the b7-pawn.  3. Expand on the queenside with a2-a4-a5 to gain space, limit Black's mobility and create potentially strong passed pawns once Black's queenside pawns are captured.  4. If Black plays ...b7-b5, then break with a2-a4, and even the manoeuvre Nb4-c6 deserves consideration.  Black's plans  1. If entry points are available, or if White's c-file is vulnerable, then double rooks on the c-file, and possibly invade the seventh rank by placing a rook on c2. This is ideal, but hard to achieve.  2. Create kingside counterplay with ...f7-f5xe4 to open the f-file. This can be followed by ...Bg7-f6-g5 to create kingside threats, and possibly ...h7-h5-h4-h3.  3. If White's play is particularly slow, then ...f7-f5, followed by ...f5-f4 and ...g6-g5-g4 might work.  4. Transfer the dark-squared bishop from g7 to b6 via f6-d8.  The reader should pay close attention to Black's Plans 2 and 3. As stated above, White can easily create diversions on the c-file, preventing Black from focusing on the kingside. This means Black's kingside play should give priority to speed. For this reason, the typical plan ...f7-f5-f4 followed by ...g6-g5-g4 could be too slow, and Black's Plan 2 is more likely to yield results. Black's Plan 3 would only work well if White's queenside play was really slow.  Examples 1 and 2 of this chapter will illustrate how White gains control of the queenside  (and the c-file)  despite Black's seemingly being in control at an earlier stage. Then, Example 3 illustrates White's excellent winning chances in the endgame. The reader should notice the similarity between this endgame and those endgames studied in Chapter 11. After Example 3 a fragment of a game illustrates Black's dream position in this structure, and later we see two more realistic examples of Black's play. The first of these showcases Black's kingside counterplay with ...f7-f5 while the second illustrates Black's queenside opportunities once some pieces come off the board. We also see Black's Plan 4 put in practice to yield excellent results. }

22. cxb5 Rxc5
{ We have reached the position of interest. The reader should examine this position very carefully and try to make an assessment of it. After analyzing this game, I would advise the reader to contrast his initial opinion and his final opinion. I imagine it might be quite different. In his analysis of this game, McShane wonders if going into this position   with  21...Nxb5  was the right decision. His original evaluation indicated that he would have sufficient counterplay with his rooks on the c-file, but as he points out, there are no entry points. This is a phenomenon which I have observed far too many times in my own experience, and in those games I have analyzed. Black’s position is reasonably good in appearance, but the truth is that it is very difficult to find counterplay, and although it is Black who is temporarily in control of the only open file, only White can really benefit from queenside play, as we will see in this game. }
23. f3
{ += A simple move that should be remembered. It provides extra support to the chain e4-d5, and it allows the bishop to come back to f2 in order to press against Black’s queenside.   As McShane points out,  23.a4 ?  is a serious imprecision, since after  23...g5  24.Bg3  f5  White is forced to destroy his ”glorious” e4-d5 chain with  25.exf5   but not  25.f3 ?  f4  25...Nxf5.  Now the d5-pawn has been weakened, while the bishop on  g3  is temporarily useless. A possible continuation is  26.Rc1  Rxc1  27.Qxc1  Rc8  28.Qd2  Rc5  with level chances. }
23... Rac8 24. Bd3
{ Something to note is how White can improve slowly, while Black can’t. The move 24.Bd3 clears e2 for the queen, prepares against ...f6-f5, and gives extra protection to the c2-square. Meanwhile, Black controls the c-file, but cannot do much with it.   Less accurate is  24.Bf2  since Black immediately gains counterplay with  24...f5  !. A possible continuation is  25.Bd3  fxe4  26.fxe4  Bf6  27.a4  Bg5  and Black is closer to equality than in the game. }
24... Qf8
{ There is nothing better than spending a tempo to prepare ...f6-f5. White was planning to follow with a3-a4, Qe2, Nc4 and only then bring his bishop back to f2.  Black cannot afford to wait with his queen on e7, as ...f6-f5 is his only constructive plan.   Attempting to ”use” the c-file with  24...Rc3  does not really go anywhere after  25.a4  when White can continue with his plans, ignoring the rook on  c3   but not  25.Rb3 ?!  since trading pieces alleviates Black’s space problems  and Black cannot insist with  25...Ra3 ?  since the rook gets trapped after:  26.Nc4  Rc3   or  26...Ra2  27.Qb3  +-  27.Rb4  +- Followed by  Qd2. }
25. Bf2
{ There is nothing else to do on h4, so the bishop comes to f2, aiming at the queenside. }
25... f5 26. a4
{ Getting ready to create a weakness in Black’s camp with a4-a5. } 26... R5c7
{ Black is not ready to close the position with  26...f4 ?  as White continues with the typical manoeuvre  27.Nc2  R5c7  28.Nb4  followed by  Nc6  with a near-winning position. For example:  28...g5  29.h3  (preventing ...g5-g4)  29...Ng8  30.Nc6  h5  31.a5  g4  32.axb6  axb6  33.Bxb6  Rb7  34.Ba7 !  Followed by b5-b6 and  Ba6  winning, while Black’s kingside attack is not getting anywhere; and if  34...Bxc6 ?!  35.dxc6  Rxa7  36.b6  and the passed pawns decide the game. }
27. h3
{ This prophylactic move protects the g4-square, and prepares against a future ...f5-f4 followed by ...g6-g5-g4.   If  27.Nc2  , to follow with Nb4-c6, then McShane was ready establish contact on the kingside with  27...g5  28.Nb4  g4  with counterplay. }
27... Bf6 28. Qd2
{ Preparing a4-a5 to create a weakness on the queenside.   If  28.Nc2  McShane intended to gain counterplay with  28...fxe4  29.fxe4  g5  followed by  ...g5-g4  with reasonable fighting chances. For example:  30.g4   or  30.Qd2  g4  31.Be3  Ng8  32.hxg4  Bxg4  with counterplay;   but not  30.Qe2 ?!  g4  31.h4  g3 !  32.Bxg3  Qg7  33.Bf2  Rg8  with excellent compensation for the pawn  30...Ng8  31.Nb4  Ne7  32.Nc6  Ng6  33.a5  Nf4  34.Bf1  h5  With sharp tactical complications. }

29... fxe4
{ It was preferable to play  29...bxa5  30.Qxa5   30.Ra1 !?  += is safer  when Black’s position requires precision, but is quite playable. For example:  30...Qf6  31.Nc4 !?  (threatening Bxa7)  31...fxe4   but not  31...Rxc4 ?  32.Bxc4  Rxc4  33.Qxa7  and the passed b-pawn decides the game  32.fxe4  Bf4 !  And the position is very far from clear since  33.Bxa7 ?  is refuted by  33...Bxh3 !  with a winning attack. }
30. fxe4
{ Better was  30.axb6 !  forcing a weakness on  b6  , rather than a7;  30...axb6  31.fxe4  ± is similar to the game. }
30... Nf7

31. axb6 axb6 32. Qe2 Rb7 33. Nc4
{ And as I said ten moves ago, only White is going to benefit from queenside play. The weakness on b6 is crippling, and prevents Black from creating further threats on the kingside. The battle is strategically won; now let’s see how Carlsen utilizes his advantage. }
33... Qd8 34. Rf1 Kg7 35. Kh1
{ Again, White can slowly improve his position, while Black’s pieces are cramped and have little to do.

38. Qf2
{ We are close to the time control on move 40, and Carlsen makes some imprecisions.   The most accurate was  38.Ba5 !  Bxb5   or  38...Rxb5  39.Bb4  Rd8  40.Nxd6 !  +-  39.Nxd6  Qxd6  40.Bxb5  with a near-winning position. }

{ Final remarks  1. The option 21...bxc5 deserves serious consideration and the reader should study it carefully in the next chapter.  2. Although Black controlled the c-file, he was unable to use it. White was able to gradually gain control of the queenside thanks to his spatial advantage.  3. Since Black had nothing to gain on the queenside, all attention should be directed to kingside play. The break ...f6-f5 was absolutely necessary, and unlike many other King’s Indian positions, advancing ...f5-f4 was not always a good idea. In fact, on moves 26-29 it would have been a poor decision since this would slow down the creation of kingside threats, while White can create a strong queenside attack very quickly. In general, White’s queenside play can distract Black’s forces rather easily once the c-file is open. }

14. Nxd6 cxd6
{ And the resulting position is the beginning of our study. We have reached the structure of this chapter, and this is the moment to assess the position. At first sight it might seem that Black is doing completely fine, as he may soon start to fight for the c-file with ...Bd7 and ...Rac8. Moreover, Black’s dark-squared bishop  (the bad bishop)  has already been traded so he should have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately for Black, reality is not so simple. The biggest problem is that, as in the previous game, White has a significant space advantage due to the favourable e4-d5 vs e5-d6 chain. Despite Black’s temporary activity, White will be able to reorganize his pieces more efficiently and emerge with a dominating position. }
15. a4 { A good continuation, to proceed with a4-a5 gaining space. } 15... Bg4

39. Rc2 Qb1 40. Bxd6
{ Final remarks  1. White’s decision to modify the structure with 14.Nxd6 was fully justified. Wojtaszek was able to see into the future of the game and realize that the c-file would ultimately belong to White, while Black would not be able to gain any counterplay.  2. A key move for White was 22.Bh3, preventing Black’s counterplay with ...f7-f5. After this move Black falls into a passive and rather desperate position.  3. The reader should see a close similarity between this position and the games Polugaevsky – Ivkov and Smeets – Tiviakov from Chapter 11, in which White inevitably gains control of the c-file due to his spatial advantage. }

The endgame was far superior, but victory was not completely guaranteed.  2. It would have been interesting for White to first press in the middlegame a little longer with 23.Qd3, as I believe Black did not really have the resources to maintain control of the c-file had White found the right continuation. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@How should Black play?@@HeaderEnd@@  White’s previous three wins were very convincing, and the reader may wonder how Black is supposed to play. I want to answer this question by first showing a short fragment from the game Bouaziz – Beliavsky, Szirak 1987.  After a Ruy Lopez opening, the game reached the position in the diagram, and now Black turned into the structure we are studying with: }
1... cxd5 2. cxd5 { And now: } 2... Ng6
{ This is a good move for two reasons. Black will improve his least-useful piece by playing ...Be7-d8-b6 while the knight on g6 is ready to jump to f4. Note how difficult it is for White to cover all the knight jumps when Black’s knights are on f6 and g6; it seems like Black always has something useful to do.   A different continuation, such as  18...bxa4  19.bxa4  Rb8  20.Qe2  a5  21.Ne3  Ng6  22.g3  Rec8  23.Bd2  +=, gives White a dominating position after  Bd3  and  Nc4.  Once again Black lacks queenside targets. }
3. axb5 axb5 4. Bd2 Be7 5. Qa1
{ If  21.Bd3  Nf4 !?   21...Bd8  might be too slow, and after  22.g3  Qb8  23.Qe2  Bb6  24.Ne3  White secures a stable position with prospects for an advantage  Black has good counterplay after  22.Bxf4  exf4  23.Qd2  Qc3 !  with a dynamic balance.   21.g3 !?  deserves attention too. }
5... Bd8 6. Rc1 Qb8 7. Bd3

7... Bb6
{ It took five moves to bring this bishop from the useless f8-square to the powerful b6-square; it was worth it. This bishop covers the entry points a7 and c7, and exerts pressure against White’s kingside. }

{ ∓ The rest of the game is irrelevant to our purposes.  Final remarks  1. It should be noted that, unlike the previous three examples, Black transferred into this pawn structure under good conditions.  2. The conditions were good because there was time for the plan ...Be7-d8-b6 to be executed, and because Black’s knights were well placed on f6 and g6. In addition, White was not in time to claim queenside space with a2-a4-a5.  The following two games are more recent and much more realistic executions of Black’s plans. }

{ We have reached a very interesting position, corresponding to the Najdorf Type II. As the reader may recall, one of the key issues in that structure is the control of the d5-square, thus we know White must be doing okay at the very least. However, comparing this position with the game Tiviakov – Anand from that chapter, we see a crucial difference: White has the wrong bishop. Typically, the light-squared bishop can be very effective on b3 if the c-pawn is still on c2; as an example, take the game Almasi – Aagaard from that chapter. In the present case though, the light-squared bishop has few prospects as it is blocked by the c4-pawn, which means Black is doing fine. }
17. Nd5+
{ This is a very unfortunate positional decision; the kind of mistake I hope you will not make after reading this book. White chooses a very bad occasion to go into the structure studied in this chapter.   Playing this position in the spirit of a Najdorf Type II yields only equality, for example:  17.Bc2  Rhc8  18.Bd3  Kf8  19.Nd2  h5  20.Nf1  Bh6  with level chances.   But instead, White could have prepared  Nd5  , hoping to obtain this chapter’s structure under favourable circumstances. I believe the strongest move was:  17.Rac1  Rac8  18.Rc2   18.Nd5+ ?  is premature due to:  18...Nxd5  19.cxd5 ?  Qxc1  ∓  18...Rhd8 ?  Permitting White’s positional threat.   18...Qxc4 ?  loses to  19.Nd5+  Bxd5  20.Rxc4  Bxc4  21.Qe3   Correct is  18...Qb8  anticipating  Nd5  , and now  19.b4 !?  += gives a small advantage to White.  19.Nd5+ !  Nxd5  20.cxd5  Qb8  21.Bc6  ± White invades down the c-file, while Black’s dark-squared bishop is far away from the action. }
17... Nxd5 18. cxd5
{ And this is a key position to analyze. The reader should ask: what is the difference between this position and Wojtaszek – Swiercz? Black is not well prepared to pursue counterplay with ...f7-f5, but under these conditions he does not even have to. The main point is that there are only two minor pieces on the board, and in particular White is missing his typically strong dark-squared bishop. Black’s pieces have sufficient space to manoeuvre, thus the position is roughly equal, or even slightly preferable for Black due to the awkward location of White’s light-squared bishop. }
18... b5
{ Another alternative was  18...Rhc8 !?  securing control of the c-file. It is possible that Black wanted to prevent  19.Bc6 !?  getting rid of the bad light-squared bishop   but not  19.Rac1 ?  Qxc1  20.Rxc1  Rxc1+  21.Ne1  Rac8  ∓   19.Ne1 ?!  is met by  19...Qc4 !  =+  19...Bxc6  20.dxc6  Qxc6  21.Qd3  when White has reasonable compensation for the pawn, but it is Black who can play for an advantage. }
19. Bb3
{ The alternative was  19.Bc2  aiming to play  Bd3  followed by a2-a4, and then  19...Bc8 !  is a good option, relocating the bishop and keeping an eye on an eventual  ...f7-f5.  20.Bd3  Qb6  21.a4  Bd7  22.axb5  axb5  Black has nothing to fear. }

The resemblance between this game and Polgar – Dominguez from Chapter 8 is astonishing, and the reader is encouraged to revisit that game. This similarity only reinforces how similar pawn structures have similar plans and strategic elements.  2. White was unable to gradually increase his queenside predominance  (as often occurs in this structure)  because two minor pieces were already off the board on move 18, and because his light-squared bishop was of little use.  3. Black’s most essential move was 28...Bf6, bringing the bishop into the game via d8-b6. This thematic manoeuvre is something to remember, as the bishop became much stronger than White’s bishop on c6. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Type II@@HeaderEnd@@  The structure studied in this chapter often arises from King's Indian and Benoni variations. It is a common variant of the most typical King's Indian structure, which is studied in the next chapter, where Black has a pawn on c7 rather than c5. By having his pawn on c5, Black is able to slow down White's queenside play, giving Black chances for a checkmating attack in standard King's Indian style. Nevertheless, White has a significant spatial advantage and may attempt active play on both flanks, which is generally enough to guarantee a small advantage.  Unlike other structures studied in this book, the tightly closed nature of this structure provides both sides with multiple ways to carry out their plans. There exist so many possibilities that analyzing a position thoroughly is a rather complex task, even with the help of an engine. In addition, many games will result in opposite-flank attacks, which are difficult to evaluate as they combine many tactical and strategic elements. Finally, I believe most of today's engines are poorly prepared to evaluate these kinds of closed positions properly, as the engines are not fully capable of foreseeing the many positional sacrifices Black may make in an attack.  As a general statement, I believe White is slightly better in most of these positions, but the resulting games are so flexible and complicated that Black always stands a chance. On the plus side, this structure's complexity is ideal for those players who absolutely need to play for a win as Black. Now let's outline specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. Create queenside tension with b2-b4, and later invade down the b-file.  2. Create central tension with the f2-f4 break, and later obtain a kingside attack, or pressure against the potentially weak d6-pawn.  3. Block the kingside with g2-g4, and then proceed with a queenside attack.  4. Trade light-squared bishops if possible, as it often reduces the strength of Black's kingside attack.  5. If possible, respond to Black's ...f7-f5 break with Ng5-e6 and make use of this outpost. This is a good idea, though Black players will rarely allow it.  Black's plans  1. Create a kingside attack by means of ...f7-f5-f4 and then ...g6-g5-g4.  2. Gain kingside activity with ...f7-f5xe4 opening the f-file. This plan is faster than Plan 1, but not as strong.  3. Advance ...h7-h5-h4, and possibly activate the fianchettoed bishop through the h6-c1 diagonal.  4. Play on the queenside with ...b7-b5, though this is far less likely as White is going to play b2-b4 and the resulting tension is usually favourable to White due to his spatial advantage.  White's Plan 1 is probably the most common, while Black's Plan 4 is pretty rare, since White has more space on the queenside and is likely to dominate this side of the board. Choosing between Black's Plans l and 2  (...f5-f4 or ...f5xe4)  depends on how far advanced White is on the queenside. Similarly to the previous chapter, if White is already creating threats, then playing ...f5-f4 and attempting ...g6-g5-g4 will be far too slow to help. In contrast, if Black has managed to neutralize White's queenside play, then Black's Plan 1 is certainly the most ambitious and advisable continuation.  Black will play ...f7-f5 in essentially every game in this structure, which means White will probably have an option to play exf5  (or in some cases be forced to make this capture)  . This capture on f5 modifies the structure significantly, and Black may recapture this pawn with the g-pawn or with a piece. The first two examples of this chapter will consider Black's recapture ...gxf5, while the third example will briefly explain what happens when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece.  The following chapter will have four additional examples of these positions, with the only difference of having a pawn on c7 rather than c5, which does not modify the character of the game so much.  After the third example the remainder of the chapter will be devoted to the study of White's plans. One example will examine White's queenside play with b2-b4, while the other will illustrate how White may carry out the f2-f4 central break successfully. White's Plan 3  (g2-g4)  is worthy of attention, but will not be included in this chapter, as a similar version of it is studied in Chapter 16. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation A@@HeaderEnd@@  Conceptually speaking, recapturing on f5 with a pawn seems to be the healthier option, keeping control of the e4-square and opening the g-file for the potential kingside attack which Black may develop.   White will often advance his f-pawn to either f3 or f4, giving rise to different types of games. The following two games will exemplify each case. White wins in the first example by playing f2-f4, and loses in the second case when playing f2-f3, but this does not mean one reaction is correct while the other is erroneous. The reader should pay close attention to why a player may choose f2-f4 over f2-f3 and vice versa. In addition, he should observe which manoeuvres give advantage to each side for each of these structures. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation B@@HeaderEnd@@  When Black recaptures on f5 with a piece, the resulting structure gives a natural outpost for White on e4. In fact, White's main plan in this position will be to establish firm control of the e4-square, preferably by occupying it with a knight. With a white knight on e4, Black's d6-pawn will be weak, and later White can proceed with the b2-b4 break which will often allow him to secure a small advantage.  Black is nor without counterplay, and he may find many active continuations based on a kingside attack. Black's potential plans could be:  1. Place knights on f4 and especially d4, to create tactical threats.  2. Play ...g6-g5-g4 to pressure White's f-pawn  (which will probably be on f3)  and then open lines for attack.  3. Fight for the control of the e4-square by placing a bishop on f5 and a knight on f6.  It is very important for Black to maintain good control of his light squares. For this reason, he should try to avoid trading light-squared bishops, as White's control of the e4-square would be far easier and Black's kingside counterplay would be less likely to work. In this chapter we see one example to illustrate this point, though in the next chapter we will see another example of a similar structure  (Rener - Giri)  , in which Black's attack is well executed. }

51. Qg8+ Kd7 52. Qe6#
{ Final remarks  1. Black’s 10...a6 weakened the b6-square permanently and this weakening proved important on many occasions throughout the game.  2. White took advantage of the b6-square when playing 13.Qb3, to threaten 14.bxc5 Nxc5 15.Qb6.   3. Later, Black had to double rooks on the b-file precisely because the b6-square was weak, otherwise there would have been no entry points and Black’s rooks could have stayed on the a- and f-files doing their jobs.  4. White’s most remarkable move was 32.g3, bringing the light-squared bishop onto a powerful diagonal. This move however, only worked well because Black’s forces were far from the kingside.  5. White’s position after move 36 displays an ideal arrangement of his forces, and in fact Black’s position is already desperate despite having a closed position and equal material. The rest is a matter of technique, and the sample variation offered is just an illustration of White’s many winning methods. }

{ I was able to find 70 games with this position in my database, where White scored over 70%. This position was first played in 1961, and for a couple of decades it was used by strong players, such as Ivkov or Fedorov. Throughout the last decade, this position has essentially disappeared from master-level games, and today it is only rarely used by players with around a 2200 rating.   During this chapter we have learned about the solidity of Black’s position, and the reader might be tempted to think this is always the case, but here we have a clear counterexample. Unlike previous games, Black’s bishop is located on e7 instead of the desirable g7, and White’s pieces are well arranged for the break f2-f4. As it turns out, Black is simply not prepared to meet this break, and White already has a serious advantage if he proceeds correctly. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Type III@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure most commonly occurs in the King's Indian Defence, though it also arises from certain lines within the Bogo-Indian, such as:   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.g3  Bb4+  4.Bd2  Qe7  5.Nf3  Nc6  6.Nc3  Bxc3  7.Bxc3  d6  8.Bg2  e5  9.d5  Nb8  Something to notice about this position is how Black has already got rid of his dark-squared bishop, which is sometimes trapped within the pawn chain, thus this approach for reaching the King's Indian Type III structure deserves consideration. Nevertheless, throughout this chapter we will showcase only examples in which Black possesses his dark-squared bishop, although many of the ideas transfer without much alteration to the case where Black does not have this bishop. This structure typically yields play on opposite Ranks in the style of a 'chain-battle'. White will hit near the base of Black's chain  (the d6-pawn)  with c4-c5, while Black will attack near the base of White's chain  (the e4-pawn)  with ...f7-f5. White's attack is founded on gaining material on the queenside, while Black's aim will be to create a mating attack against White's king, which will often castle short in this structure.  White's plans  1. Break on the queenside with c4-c5xd6 and later invade down the c-file.  2. Expand on the queenside with c4-c5-c6, and if Black replies with ...b7-b6, then invade down the a-file after a2-a4-a5xb6.  3. First block the kingside with g2-g4, and only then proceed with the above queenside plans.  4. If Black allows it, respond to ...f7-f5 with Ng5-e6; although similar to the previous chapter, Black is unlikely to allow White to do this under favourable conditions.  5. Trade light-squared bishops so as to reduce Black's attacking potential.  Black's plans  1. Create a kingside attack with ...f7-f5-f4 and later ...g6-g5-g4-g3, or ...gxf3 attacking the f3-pawn, which becomes the new base of the chain.  2. Obtain counterplay with ...f7-f5xe4 followed by action down the f-file and/or attacking the base of the chain  (the e4-pawn)  .  3. In some cases, play ...h7-h5-h4 and even ...Bg7-h6 to make use of the otherwise trapped bishop on g7.  4. Play ...c7-c6 to create central tension and possibly transpose into a King's Indian Type I structure.  5. Play ...c7-c5 to slow down White's queenside play and transpose into a King's Indian Type II structure.  White's Plans 1 and 2 are by far the most common, while Black's Plan 1 is certainly the most common reply, although in many variations Black will choose any of the remaining four plans he has. Black's Plan 3 is particularly common in the Petrosian variation, and we will see an example of this. Similarly to the previous chapter, White always has the option to reply to ...f7-f5 with exf5, transforming the structure, when Black may either recapture on f5 with a piece or a pawn. These structure transformations are mentioned separately at the beginning of the chapter.  The first four examples in this chapter are devoted to the structure transformation after White captures exf5. The first two are about Black's ...gxf5 reply while the remaining two consider the case when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece. Then we briefly discuss how pieces are typically arranged once Black has played ...f5-f4, after which we study one example of Black's Plan 1.  Note that Black's light-squared bishop plays a major role, both protecting light squares and helping in the attack. In fact, the subsequent example in this chapter  (Azarov - Volke)  shows how Black's attack loses its strength once the light-squared bishops are off the board. The remaining two games examine White's Plan 3. The first of these is a successful implementation, while the second is a great example of how Black should react. Essentially all the plans mentioned above are present in these examples, either within the game itself or within the analysis. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation A@@HeaderEnd@@  Similarly to the previous chapter, the recapture ...gxf5 seems healthier, keeping control of the e4-square and opening the g-file for a kingside attack. A disadvantage of this recapture is that Black's kingside could become vulnerable, as we will see in the next example.   Also in similar style to the previous chapter, White will often advance his f-pawn to either f3 or f4, giving rise to different types of games. The games will develop similarly to those games from the previous chapter, namely Piorun - Hillarp Persson in which White played f2-f3, and Wojtaszek - Fedorov in which White played f2-f4. This time around White will get a good position from playing f2-f3 in the first example, and a bad position from playing f2-f4 in the second case - the exact opposite to the previous chapter. The reader should not attempt to draw general conclusions about whether f2-f3 or f2-f4 is always the best reply. Instead, he should observe how the arrangement of pieces and the circumstances of each game determine which continuation is best. }

{ So far we have closely followed the theory, and now we are in the structure of interest. In contrast to the game Wojtaszek – Fedorov from the previous chapter, White’s bishop is on c2, rather than g2. Hence, playing f2-f3 makes far more sense now. }

For example, if White insists on a kingside break, then after  15.Qd2  b6  16.Kh2  Qe8  17.Rg1  Qg6  18.g3  Bd7  19.Nd1  h5  20.Nf2  a6 !?  =+ Black gains queenside counterplay with  ...b6-b5  before White accomplishes anything on the kingside. }

{ Final remarks  1. What the reader should remember from this example is the combination between White’s bishops on c2 and e3, and the move f2-f3. If either bishop was missing, this set-up would be far less effective. For example, in the game Piorun – Hillarp Persson from the previous chapter, White’s bishop was not on e3, therefore, he could not prevent the knight transfer to f4.  2. White’s g2-g4 break requires precise calculation but is not quite as uncommon as it might seem. It works well together with a bishop on c2. }

As we may recall from the game Wojtaszek – Fedorov from the previous chapter, White’s kingside break g3-g4 was very strong, and not having such a plan in this position is already disappointing.  2. Black’s key move was 21...Nc5, bringing the knight into the game, heading towards g3, before closing the central structure with ...e5-e4.   3. White’s imprecise play allowed Black to gain crucial tempos on moves 26-30, helping Black achieve his dream position.  4. Once Black installed his knight on g3 and doubled rooks on the a-file, there was essentially nothing White could hope for, and the sample variation I chose to finish off this game illustrates that. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Transformation B@@HeaderEnd@@  As in the previous chapter, when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece, White obtains an outpost on e4. White's main plan in this position will be to place a well-supported knight on e4 and later break on the queenside with   c4-c5 securing an advantage.  Black's counterplay will be based on kingside action; among his potential plans are the following:  1. Place a knight on f4  (or maybe d4)  , to create tactical threats.  2. Play ...g6-g5-g4 to pressure White's f-pawn  (which is likely to be on f3)  and then open lines for attack.  3. Fight for control of the e4-square by placing a bishop on f5 and a knight on f6.  As we learned in the previous chapter, in the example Mareco - Bachmann, White's position is much the more favourable if light-squared bishops are off the board, because it is easier to control the e4-square, and because Black's dark-squared bishop can turn into a terribly bad bishop, as it did in that game. In this chapter we will repeat this idea, which remains valid. }

13. Rc1
{ This supports c4-c5 in order to gain queenside play. The position is typical, though not very deeply explored by theory, and it is a good moment to assess the situation. As we know, White desires to obtain firm control of the e4-square, and he will accomplish this after 14.f3 and 15.Ndf2. Hence, it makes sense for Black to begin fighting for the e4-square immediately.   White was more likely to secure a tiny advantage after  13.f3  Nf6  14.Ndf2  Nd4  15.Bd3  with good control of the e4-square. For example,  15...Nh5  16.Re1  Nf4  17.Bf1  += when White’s kingside remains solid and he may proceed with  18.Bc3  to expel the knight from  d4. }

He may follow up with  ...g6-g5-g4  and possibly  ...Bh6  afterwards, trading his ‘bad’ bishop.

17. Rc3
{ This is not exactly a mistake, but it is certainly the beginning of an unnatural plan.   The alternative was  17.Qd2  a5  18.f3  Bg7  when Black has good counterplay associated with  ...h6-h5  and  ...Bh6  , but White may attempt a slow expansion with  19.b3 !?  following up with a2-a3 and b3-b4   or  19.Ndf2  h5  20.Bxf5  Bxf5  21.Ng5  Bh6  22.h4  with level chances   If White insists on c4-c5 with  17.b4  then  17...a5 !  18.a3  axb4  19.axb4  and Black has a good position after  19...Bg5 !?  20.Ra1  Rxa1  21.Qxa1  h5  22.Bxf5  Bxf5. }

One of Black’s most important moves was 13...Nf6 forcing White to choose between giving up his e4-square or giving up his dark squares, as he did in the game.  2. Later, the control of the e4-square played a significant role. As the reader may have noticed, White’s position began to fall apart once his knight was forced out of e4, on move 32.   3. As we could observe in this game, Black should have good fighting chances along the f-file as long as he can control the c4-c5 break with pawns on a5 and b6, as he did in the game. }

16... a6
{ In some similar positions, Black just plays  16...Rf7  and after  17.Nxa7  Bd7  the kingside attack keeps on going, but this is not one of those cases, as after  18.a4  Bh6  19.Bb5 !  White can secure a stable advantage:  19...Rg7  20.Bxd7  Qxd7  21.Nb5  g4  22.Kh1  As we will see in the next game, the attack loses most of its energy once light-squared bishops are off the board.

20... Qe8
{ We have reached the critical moment in the game, and the utmost precision is required from both sides. I should emphasize that White’s five-move knight manoeuvre to c6 is actually far more common than it might seem; the knight is quite strong on c6, and disrupts Black’s coordination. On the other hand, White’s queenside attack is not as powerful anymore, since the only aggressive plan lies in a2-a4. In contrast, Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn next move with ...g4-g3. Should White worry? We will see in a moment. For now, I would say we have a relatively standard Mar del Plata position, which in this case offers objectively better chances to White, but just one slip is enough for Black to seize the opportunity to execute a near-decisive kingside attack. }
21. Kh1
{ This is where everything goes wrong for White. Although this is not exactly a mistake, it implies that White will respond to 21...g3 with 22.Bg1, which is just a bad plan as we will see.

The key move.  25...Nhxf4   or  25...Ngxf4 !?  26.Bxh4  Bf6  with a complex game  26.Bg4  += Black’s kingside attack is unlikely to succeed. }
22... gxh2 23. Bf2
{ White has been heading towards this position for the last three moves, and here we are. Is it a good position for White? Throughout the last decade I have heard innumerable respectable players explain to me, or others, how every time that Black plays the sacrifice ...g4-g3, White should simply react with Bg1 and after ...gxh2 then Bf2 ! would terminate Black’s attack, because the h2-pawn would serve as a shield. I presume this piece of wisdom is mostly based on hearsay, so here I would like to put in writing how wrong, or at least misleading, this advice is. Black’s attack simply moves on, and as the reader will see, there is no reason to believe White’s position is safer because of the h2-pawn.   Better was  23.Bxh2  , though after  23...h4  24.a4  Nh5  25.Kg1  Ng3  26.Rf2  h3 !  it is Black who plays for the advantage.

23... h4
{ =+ Preparing ...Nh5-g3. Maybe this is too early, but I would dare to say that White’s position is near desperate already, as Black has taken the initiative and White no longer finds the time to carry out any aggressive queenside plans. In fact, after several hours of analysis, I could not find any decent continuation for White. For now I just call this position ”slight advantage for Black” though I do not think White can prevent the position from becoming ”big advantage for Black”! }
24. Nd3
{ The attempt  24.a4  bxa4  25.Qxa4  is too slow, and can be met by  25...Nh5 !?  26.Kxh2  Ng3  ∓ with a huge advantage due to the potential threat  ...h4-h3. }
24... Nh5 25. Kxh2

27. Bb6
{ If  27.Be1  Bf6  28.Nf2  White gets an unpleasant position that is similar to the game after:  28...h3 !  29.gxh3  Rh7  ∓ When a possible continuation is  30.Qd3  Qf8  31.Bf1  Qh6  32.Ng4  Bxg4  33.fxg4  Bh4  when the threat of  ...Nxf1  and  ...Bg3  wins in basically every variation, such as:  34.Rc3  Rf8  35.Qf3  Nxf1+  36.Rxf1  Bg3+ !  -+ }
27... Bf6 28. Nf2 h3
{ ∓ A great sacrifice. By giving up this pawn Black obtains an open g-file and a semi-open h-file to bring White’s king under fire. There are so many threats that White cannot take advantage of his extra pawn, let alone be able to make further progress on the queenside.   Note that  28...Rh7 !?  also gives excellent attacking chances to Black. A long but very instructive variation is:  29.Nh3  (it is necessary to block ...h4-h3)  29...Nf8  30.a4  Searching for counterplay, but Black just keeps on going:  30...Rg7  31.axb5  axb5  32.Bd3   or  32.Bxb5  Bxh3  33.gxh3  Rb7  winning a piece  32...Nh7  33.Rc2  Ng5 !  -+ Lifting the  h3  blockade. White can only wait and see how Black breaks through the defence with a well-prepared ...h4-h3:  34.Nxg5  Rxg5  35.Bf1  Qh5  36.Qe1  Kg7  37.Rf2  h3  38.gxh3  Bxh3 !  With forced mate. }

32... Nf5
{ -+ This rather surprising blow decides the game very nicely and quickly. White’s king is so vulnerable that even an extra piece will not help him survive. }

{ Declining the piece sacrifice with  33.Bb6  does not help as after  33...Bg3+  34.Kh1  Ne3  35.Bxe3  fxe3  White is just lost.

33... Bxf2 34. fxg6 { Or  34.Rf1  Bg3+  35.Kg1  Nh4  and wins. } 34... Qxg6
{ There is nothing to do against the checkmating threat ...Qg3 and ...Bxh3; note the minor role White’s knight has played in the fight. }
35. Qf1 { Even easier is:  35.Rf1  Qg3+  36.Kh1  Rxh3+  37.Bxh3  Qxh3# } 35...
Qg3+ 36. Kh1 Kf8 { The most precise, getting out of the g-file pin. } 37. Nxe5
Bxh3 38. Ng6+ Ke8
{ White resigns as mate is unavoidable.  Final remarks  1. The biggest fact to remember from this game is the ineffectiveness of White’s moves 21-23 – that is, the plan of Kh1 and then Bf2-g1-f2. Although this is a typical response to Black’s ...g6-g5-g4-g3 plan, it does not work as well as many believe.  2. Black’s 23...h4 ! played a key role in this win, as it is the best way to open lines on the kingside in order to checkmate White’s king. The plan ...Nh5-g3 followed by ...h4-h3 is very strong and practically irresistible. }

13... Nh5 14. c5 f4
{ A general piece of advice for King’s Indian players is to decide beforehand whether an opposite-flanks race is likely to work or not. If Black is likely to lose the race, then he should not start it at all, and instead should attempt to find counter-chances by keeping the central tension. In this case, the way White’s kingside structure is set up should be a red flag for Black. In previous examples Black’s attack has proven effective due to the advance ...g6-g5-g4-g3, but what is Black supposed to do in this case? Any feasible attack will take much longer, while White’s forces are already arriving at the queenside.   Much more principled is  14...Nf6  (preparing ...fxe4)  and now  15.cxd6 !?   while  15.Bg2  can be answered by the unorthodox  15...dxc5 !?  16.bxc5  fxe4  17.Ndxe4  Nfxd5  with level chances.  15...cxd6  16.b5  fxe4  17.Ndxe4  yields a level position }
15. Nc4 Ng8

16. a4

16... Ngf6 17. Ra2 Ne8

18. Rc2
{ Another option was  18.g4 !?  Nhf6  19.f3  , which is similar to the game. }
18... Bd7 19. g4

25. Nc4
{ The threat is a4-a5 opening up the a-file immediately, thus it is necessary to play: }
25... a6
{ A new phase in the game has begun. Black’s pieces are so constrained they cannot play, hence Black will spend the next twenty moves simply waiting for the end. Meanwhile, White has complete freedom to manoeuvre in order to find the right winning method. Note how Black is ready to close the queenside. If White plays a4-a5, then Black replies ...b6-b5, and if White plays b4-b5, then Black replies ...a6-a5. Therefore, when White decides to push one of his queenside pawns, he will need to think how exactly he desires to sacrifice a piece in order to break Black’s last line of defence. }
26. Rh2
{ This prophylactic move is intended to keep an eye on the kingside in case Black attempts the shake things up with ...Nxg5.   If  26.a5  b5  the position is momentarily closed. }

34... a5
{ The game is entirely closed, and now White will prepare the decisive break.   Even worse is  34...axb5 ?  35.axb5  as White wins on the spot after  35...Bf8  36.Qa4  Bg7  37.Qa7.   If  34...Ra8  then  35.a5 !  opens up the queenside decisively:  35...axb5  36.Nxb5  bxa5  37.Be1  Bf8  38.Nxa5  +- The c6-pawn prevents Black’s manoeuvres, making White’s queenside invasion easy. }
35. Ne2 { The beginning of a lengthy yet winning manoeuvre: Nc3-e2-c1-b3xa5. }

44. hxg5 Qxg5 45. a5 Qd8 46. b6 cxb6 47. axb6

Rxa3 48. Nxa3 g5 49. Qb4 g4 50. Bh4 Be7 51. b7 Bxh4 52. b8=Q
{ Final remarks  1. Black’s biggest mistake was attempting a kingside attack with 14...f4. Instead, Black should have transformed the structure into a King’s Indian Type III-B with 14...Nf6 and 15...fxe4 obtaining a playable position by analogy with the previous games.  2. Unlike previous examples, White’s kingside pawns on f2-g3-h2 are hard to attack, as there is no clear target. This fact made Black’s attack ineffective, besides which Black was already far behind when this race began.  3. The reason White was winning after 22.h4 was that he had an enormous space advantage all over the board. As we will see in the next example, closing the kingside by itself does not guarantee an advantage if Black can secure some space on the queenside.  Throughout this book I have been hesitant to include rapid games  (let alone blindfold chess)  , as I prefer games played at the highest level. In this case, I thought it was worthwhile making an exception, as in the next game Carlsen’s execution is simply superb and an ideal example for the position. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Open KID@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure most typically comes from the King's Indian Defence when Black captures with ...e5xd4, though the same structure can be obtained in some lines of the Bogo-Indian, or the Philidor Defence as soon as White manages to play c2-c4 to increase his spatial advantage. In most of these positions, Black will include the moves ...g7-g6 to fianchetto the bishop, and ...c7-c6 to prevent White from placing a knight on d5.  White often enjoys a small advantage in this structure because of his space and because the d6-pawn can be a serious target either in the middlegame or in an eventual endgame. The opening and post-opening phase are crucial, as these moves often determine whether Black will obtain counterplay or not. If White manages to arrange his pieces ideally without first falling into some tactical problems, then he is likely to have a lasting advantage, forcing Black into a dull defensive task. So why do Black players accept this structure? There are two reasons:  1. If one wishes to play the King's Indian Defence, it is unavoidable to play this structure once in a while.  2. These positions can lead to sharp tactical complications which give Black realistic chances to play for the full point. High tactical precision is often required from both sides.  White's plans  1. Pressure along the d-file, attacking the vulnerable d6-pawn.  2. Expand on the kingside with f2-f4, and possibly g2-g4.  3. When the right time comes, break on the kingside with either e4-e5 or f4-f5.  4. Avoid an excessive trade of pieces in order to make use of the spatial advantage.  5. If this is possible, expand on the queenside as well with a2-a3 and b2-b4.  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to decrease the space problem. Trading a couple of minor pieces is often good enough.  2. Place knights on e5 and c5 and then play ...Qb6-b4 attacking the c4-pawn. If White replies b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3 followed by ...Ra3 is a good plan. The drawback of this plan is that Black's queen can be targeted.  3. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5 to unleash his pieces.  4. Dispute White's control of the centre with the break ...f7-f5, trading the f-pawn for White's e4-pawn.  5. Attack White's c4-pawn with ...a7-a6, ...c7-c6 and ...b7-b5, to reduce White's control of the centre.  6. Create a kingside attack; place a knight on f4, and possibly play ...g6-g5, to control the f4-square, and to prevent White from expanding with f3-f4.  For White, the most important task is to keep his pieces well coordinated while refraining from trading pieces if possible. If this is achieved, then the d6-pawn will remain vulnerable while the kingside expansion will be easily achievable. For Black, the most important task is to remain active and to be able to continuously create threats, or trade pieces, before White gains a stable advantage. Black's Plan 3, the ...d6-d5 break, is ideal but very hard to accomplish in practice. Black's remaining plans are all equally important and choosing among them requires good calculating ability more than anything else.  As a King's Indian player I was often reluctant to play the plan with ...g6-g5  (Plan 6)  because it seems to be a positional aberration. But it turns out that this plan can actually be very effective if applied correctly, and we will see some examples in this chapter.  The first game in this chapter is an example of White's ideal piece arrangement and the subsequent kingside expansion. The second example illustrates how Black's Plan 2 can backfire and his queen can become trapped. The third example briefly discusses Black's ...f7-f5 break, and then we move on to Black's ...g6-g5 plans with three examples.  It might seem paradoxical that I say this structure is superior for White and then I include only two examples in which White wins. The reason for this decision was that the first example in this chapter is good enough to describe most of White's victories. In fact, White wins the first game in such a convincing manner that I spend the rest of the chapter providing ideas for Black players to fight against White's seemingly superior strategy. }

A better defence was:  21...Nbd7  22.Nf3   now the attack with  22.f5 ?!  will not work well due to  22...Ne5 !  since a knight on  e5  can comfortably protect the kingside  22...Qc7  23.Bd4  Bxd4+  24.Nxd4  += White has a preferable position because of the space advantage and the weakened dark squares around Black’s king. }

28. Kh1
{ Getting out of the a7-g1 diagonal, threatening Ng5 and fxg6 with a crushing kingside attack.   Less precise is  28.Ng5 ?!  due to  28...Qc5 !  offering to trade queens. White retains strong attacking chances, but things can get more complicated. For example, after  29.Re3  when in the event of  29...gxf5  30.gxf5  Bxf5 !?  a very sharp position arises. }
28... Qc5

29. e5
{ A severe miscalculation; I presume both sides were in time pressure by this point.   Instead, the simple  29.Qg2 !  keeps all options open. There is no defence against White’s multiple threats, for example  29...Qa5   or  29...Bg7  30.e5  threatening Ne4:  30...d5  31.e6 !  fxe6  32.f6  Bf8  33.Ne5  +-  30.Bg3  Winning the d6-pawn and the game. }
29... d5

30. Qc2

Bxf5 34. gxf5 Qa5 35. Ne4 Be7 36. Qxc4 Bxh4 37. Nxh4
{ Final remarks  1. It is hard to find suggestions for Black to improve. While 21...Bd7 was certainly inconvenient, the position was simply inferior regardless. Black’s problems started early on when White managed to arrange his pieces ideally before Black could create any concrete counterplay.  2. White’s kingside attack runs smoothly because of his ideal control of the centre, and because the weakness of the d6-pawn is constantly distracting Black from other offensive or defensive tasks. }

19... Nf4 20. Bxf4 gxf4 21. c5
{ A sign of desperation, giving up a pawn in order to trade Black’s powerful bishop on e6 for the otherwise useless bishop on b3.  Unfortunately, White will be a pawn down for no compensation.   It was better to attempt a defence with:  21.Rd3  Kh7  22.Kf1  Rad8  23.Red1   but not  23.Ke2 ?  due to  23...f5 !  24.gxf5  Bxf5  ∓  25.exf5 ??

21... Bxb3 22. axb3 dxc5
{ The rest of the game bears no relevance to us, though Black exploited his advantage very easily.  Final remarks  1. White’s biggest mistake was playing 16.Bb3, as this bishop was needed in the defence of the kingside.  2. Black’s post-opening sequence  (moves 11-18)  deserve to be praised. Note how Black keeps the threats coming, managing to trade one minor piece, prevent f2-f4 with 16...Be5, and then even create a kingside attack with 18...Qh4.   3. From a static perspective  (ignoring tactics or the initiative)  Black’s ...g6-g5-g4 break does not look good. By trading his g-pawn for White’s h-pawn Black weakens his structure significantly. The point here is that Black cannot afford to obtain a passive position and this plan is a great method for obtaining activity. If Black executes the ...g6-g5-g4 break well, then White will not have the time to take advantage of Black’s structural weaknesses. }

Black was unable to maintain the central tension and was eventually forced to play ...exd4 obtaining an open King’s Indian. It would have been better to accept this pawn structure with 10...exd4 and begin searching for counterplay before White could consolidate his position.  2. White’s biggest mistake was 20.a3, allowing the a-file to be opened. From this point on, Black’s play was a good model of how Black may obtain counterplay.  3. The advance ...g6-g5  (as I chose on move 30)  is not quite as uncommon as one might expect for such a wild-looking move. We have already seen some examples earlier in the chapter. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@KID Complex@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure is most typically obtained from the King's Indian and the Old Indian Defences, though it can also appear in the Ruy Lopez. I decided to name this structure King's Indian Complex to be consistent with the term introduced by Soltis in the 1970's. This structure is called a 'complex' because it is a highly flexible structure open to many possibilities. In fact, this structure could transpose to seven  (!)  structures we have previously discussed in this book, and here we still need to discuss some independent structural developments.  Here follows the outline of possible structure transformations:  1. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and White replies exd5, we obtain a Najdorf Type I  (Chapter 8)  .  2. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and White recaptures with a piece, we obtain a NajdorfType II  (Chapter 9)  .  3. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and White replies cxd5, to obtain a King's Indian Type I  (Chapter 14)  .  4. White plays d4-d5 and Black replies ...c6-c5, then we obtain a King's Indian Type II  (Chapter 15)  .  5. White plays d4-d5 while Black's pawn was still on c7, then we obtain a King's Indian Type III  (Chapter 16)  .  6. Black takes ...exd4, then we obtain an Open King's Indian  (Chapter 17)  .  And in this chapter we will consider two additional possibilities:  7. White takes with dxe5 and Black replies ...dxe5. This chapter will mostly focus on ideas about this structure.  8. White breaks with c4-c5, blowing up the centre. This break will probably give White a favourable version of a 4-2 vs. 3-3 structure, which was mentioned in Chapter 3.  Despite the long list of structures and possibilities mentioned above, I believe the most common outcomes from a King's Indian complex are 4, 5 and 7, and since Cases 4 and 5 have been previously studied, four of the five games in this chapter will be devoted to studying the structure resulting from Case 7. The last game in the chapter will be an example of White's c4-c5 break. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@White takes dxe5 and Black replies ...dxe5@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure occurs when pawns are traded on e5 in a King's Indian complex; it is essentially the only structure with an independent value, i.e. a structure not discussed in previous chapters. Despite the apparent symmetry of the position there is a visible imbalance due to the placement of the c-pawns. White's c4-pawn is more advanced giving some spatial advantage, especially if the pawn is further advanced with c4-c5. In contrast, Black's c6-pawn covers the important d5-square, preventing White's knight from going there. The strategic battle is based on this fact. Black will direct his efforts toward controlling the d4-square, while White will attempt to gain space, obtain other advantages and prevent Black from making use of d4. The specific plans are:  White's plans  1. Modify the structure with the c4-c5 advance. Later, place a piece on the new outpost on d6.  2. Defend the d4-square, and prevent Black from occupying it.  3. Expand on the queenside with a2-a3 and b2-b4. Control the d-file and possibly invade on the seventh rank.  Black's plans  1. Place a piece on the d4-square, preferably a knight.  2. Control the dark squares in general; trade dark-squared bishops. Also, play ...a7-a5 and place a knight on c5.  3. Create kingside play with ...f7-f5, especially as a distraction to White's queenside plans. White's Plan 1 is by far the most important and the beginning moves in this structure will rotate around it, as White wants to achieve it while Black desires to prevent it. If this advance can be permanently banned, then Black will generally be doing well. In contrast, if White manages to play c4-c5 then Black will need to react quickly, and Plan 3  (...f7-f5 with kingside play)  is most likely to be the right approach.  The first two examples in this chapter illustrate Black's dark-squared strategy - the control of the d4-square and the prevention of White's c4-c5 advance. Later, the third game showcases an easy victory for White after the c4-c5 advance is achieved. The fourth game in the chapter illustrates how Black responds to White's c4-c5 advance by creating kingside play with ...f7-f5.  Although I usually prefer recent top games over older games, I could not resist the temptation to begin this chapter with one of Kasparov's classic games, against Danailov from 1980. This game is a superb example of Black's dream strategy in this position. White certainly made some serious mistakes, but these mistakes are very illustrative and deserve study. }

Many King’s Indian players are afraid of this Exchange Variation because they worry that White can secure a draw with it. I hope this example gives some ideas about how to play for an advantage once White commits any inaccuracies.  2. It is extremely important to remember White’s positional mistake with 14.Bxf6. This trade gives up the control of the dark squares, which Black then uses in an ideal fashion.  3. Black took advantage of his dark-square dominance with great elegance and precision. Probably the most important part in imposing the advantage was the manoeuvre ...Bd8, ...a5-a4 and ...Ba5 turning an otherwise useless bishop into a powerful attacking piece. }

Final remarks  1. White’s decision to trade with 8.dxe5 followed by 9.Qxd8 was reasonable, but not the most ambitious. He certainly could have obtained an equal position given more precise play, though it would have been difficult to play for an advantage.  2. The biggest problem for White was 12.a3 hoping for the impossible b2-b4. White should calculate this in advance, and if b2-b4 cannot be achieved, then a2-a3 should not be played.  3. Black’s position became clearly more comfortable after ...a5-a4, as this move prevented White’s queenside play and left the c4-pawn ‘isolated’ from the b-pawn and therefore vulnerable.  4. Black’s decision to open up the game with 24...f5 proved very effective and it was a logical approach as White had given up the pair of bishops. This move allowed the game to be won very easily and convincingly. }

In this game the ...b7-b6 idea did not work well because Black’s a-pawn was already on a6. So if White played c5xb6 then Black would have to recapture with a piece, leaving the c6-pawn isolated, as we saw in the note to 24...b5.   2. Once White achieved the c4-c5 advance a crucial element in the victory was bringing in pieces with Kh2-h4-Bh3 and later simply trading off those pieces Black was using to keep his queenside protected.

Once White has achieved the c4-c5 advance, the kingside reaction ...f7-f5 is necessary. The resulting position is often complicated and risky for both sides, but Black does not have much of a choice if he wants to avoid a painful defeat, as we saw in the previous example.  2. White lost this game due to his lack of precision. In general his plans were correct, but he missed some key opportunities to stay in control, such as 18.exf5 which could have secured a small advantage in a complex position. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@French Type I@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure often arises from the French and Caro-Kann defences, after Black challenges White's pawn chain with the typical ...f7-f6 break. The most important theme in this position is the control of the e5-square. If White is able to gain firm control of this square his position will generally be superior. For this reason Black must find counterplay rather quickly in order to avoid being dominated. Black's counterplay will usually be based on attacking White's d4-pawn. For this reason Black will typically play ...c5xd4 rather than ...c5-c4, which would release the tension on the d4-pawn, and thus allow White to have a solid centre. Specific plans are as follows.  White's plans  1. Control the e5-square and use it as an outpost for a knight, although a rook or bishop would also be powerful on this square.  2. Pressure the backward e6-pawn by doubling rooks on the e-file.  3. If White has already gained control of e5, then expand on the kingside, possibly with f2-f4 or h2-h4-h5 in order to create an attack.  Black's plans  All Black's plans are essentially based on preventing White from controlling the e5-square; they are:  1. Pressure the d4-pawn, play ...c7-c5xd4, ...Nc6 and sometimes ...Qb6.  2. Bring the light-squared bishop into the game with ...Bd7-e8-h5  (or g6)  . Since White typically has a knight on f3, a bishop on h5 would produce an unpleasant pin  (against White's queen on d1)  while also undermining the d4-pawn.  3. Double rooks on the f-file and possibly follow up with the exchange sacrifice ...Rxf3 capturing White's knight, undermining White's centre and kingside.  4. Achieve the central break ...e6-e5, to obtain an isolated and passed d-pawn.  As the reader may notice, this position is fairly one-dimensional. Everything revolves around the e5-square, and I believe the key for both sides is to know when it is a good idea to go into this position, and when it is not. The first game in this chapter will illustrate White's domination once he achieves control of the e5-square. Essentially all of his plans will be combined to yield a very convincing victory. The second example illustrates Black's exchange sacrifice with ...Rxf3 and the third example showcases Black's Plan 4 and the resulting position in which the isolated d-pawn is both a potential weakness and a potential threat because it is also a passed pawn.  This chapter is relatively short because the ideas presented in this structure are rather simple. In addition, the reason I only include one victory for White is because most of White's victories follow exactly the same path. I found many good examples, but they all communicate the same ideas over and over. What the reader must understand is: once White controls the e5-square he will have an excellent position and most of the plans listed above will be possible and strong. }

Worse is  12...Qxf6  due to:  13.Nb3 !  c4   Or if  13...cxd4 ?!  then the strong  14.Nbxd4 !  threatens Black in many ways, such as Nb5-c7.  14...Nxd4  15.cxd4  ± With a typical ”dream position” for this structure.  14.Nbd2  Followed by the standard plans Nf1-e3-g4-e5, or  Bf4  , or h2-h4-h5. White has a very comfortable position, as Black cannot even attempt to get the typical counterplay by attacking the d4-pawn.   12...Bxf6  13.Nf1  += is very similar to the game. }
13. h3
{ Preventing a potential ...Ng4, and getting ready to invade the e5-square.   It was possible to capture with  13.dxc5  but after  13...e5  Black gets some compensation for the pawn, as he has good control of the centre.   A slightly stronger alternative was  13.Nb3  threatening  Nxc5  , forcing the c5-pawn to ”state his intentions”.  13...c4   or  13...cxd4  14.Nbxd4  Qb6  15.Re2  += followed by  Bf4  controlling the e5-square  14.Nbd2  += White has a comfortable advantage, as in the note above. The key is how well supported the d4-pawn is.   In the event of the immediate  13.Ne5 ?!  Black solves his problems after:  13...cxd4  14.Nxc6  bxc6  15.cxd4  e5 !  16.dxe5  Ng4   this is what White wanted to prevent with  13.h3  17.Nf3  Nxe5  With an equal position. }
13... b6
{ If  13...cxd4  14.cxd4  Qb6  creating direct pressure against the d4-pawn, then  15.Nb1 !?  redirecting the knight to  c3.  15...Bd7   or  15...Ne4  16.Nc3 !  Nxd4  17.Nxe4  dxe4  18.Rxe4  Nxf3+  19.Bxf3  += with a superior pawn structure  16.Nc3  Rac8  17.Rb1  += Followed by  Bf4  controlling the e5-square. }
14. Ne5 Bb7
{ Now  14...Nxe5 ?  is punished by:  15.dxe5 !  It is usually better to occupy the e5-square with a piece   the standard reply would be  15.Rxe5  but here there is a tactical justification:  15...Nd7  16.Nc4 !  This is the key.  16...Rb8   but not  16...dxc4 ?  17.Bxa8  +-  17.Nd6  Rf8  18.f4  ± }
15. Ndf3 { Reinforcing the control of e5. } 15... Nxe5
{ The alternative  15...Ne4  seems tempting, but  16.Nxc6  Bxc6  17.Bf4  += followed by  Ne5  gives comfortable control of  e5. }
16. Nxe5 Nd7 17. Bf4 cxd4 18. cxd4 Rc8 19. Nxd7 Qxd7 20. Be5
{ White has a clear advantage for the following reasons:  1. He has undisputed control of the e5-square.  2. The e6-pawn is a long-term weakness.  3. Black’s light-squared bishop is blocked by his own pawns.  4. Black’s kingside may become vulnerable after the typical h3-h4-h5. }
20... Bh6
{ Preserving the dark-squared bishop, hoping for some counterplay, although Black does not have much to aim for anyway.   Let’s see another approach:  20...Bxe5  21.Rxe5  Qc7  Black intends to play  ...Qc2.   Attempting a c-file invasion with  21...Rc7  is refuted by  22.Bf1  Rec8  23.Bd3  ± covering the c2-square. White’s bishop is extremely powerful on  d3  , as it supports the idea h3-h4-h5 attacking the g6-pawn.  22.Qg4 !  Attacking the e6-pawn.  22...Qf7   But not  22...Qc2 ?!  due to  23.Rxe6  Qxb2  24.Rae1  with a fierce attack. For example:  24...Rf8  25.R6e2  Rc2   or  25...Qb4  26.Re7  and wins  26.Rxc2  Qxc2  27.Re7  Qxf2+  28.Kh1  With a crushing attack against Black’s monarch.  23.Qe2  ± Followed by  Rae1  and h3-h4-h5, which is similar to the game. }
21. h4
{ Another option was  21.Bf1 !?  relocating the bishop to  d3.  Then  21...Rf8  22.Bd3  Qf7  23.Qe2  ± followed by  h3-h4-h5 after the necessary preparation. }
21... Qf7 22. Bh3
{ This is another good route for White’s bishop, pressuring the e6-pawn. }
22... Bc6 23. Qd3 Bd7 24. Re2 Rc6 25. Rae1
{ White’s play is rather simple; he improves his position by exerting pressure on the e6-pawn.   Another option was  25.Kg2 !?  Rec8  26.Rh1  followed by  Bg4  and h4-h5, which is similar to the game. }
25... a5
{ It is not advisable to play  25...Rec8  due to  26.Qa6  threatening the a7-pawn. The point is that after  26...Be8 ?  Black loses on the spot after the forcing line:  27.Bf4 !  (threatening Bxe6 and Bxh6)  27...Bxf4  28.Bxe6  Rxe6  29.Qxc8  Rxe2  30.Rxe2  Kf8  31.gxf4 }
26. Kg2 Rc4
{ There is nothing productive to do, hence Black begins to play waiting moves while White continues to make progress.   If  26...Rec8  27.Bg4  Rc1  , intending to trade a pair of rooks to lessen Black’s problems, then  28.Rxc1  Rxc1  29.Rc2 !  Rxc2  30.Qxc2  followed by  Qc7  invading Black’s camp with a near-decisive advantage.   Even worse is  26...Rc1 ?  due to:  27.Rxc1  Bxc1  28.Rc2  Bh6  29.Rc7  +- }
27. Bg4 Rc6 28. Rh1 Rec8 29. h5
{ Finally we are there! Areshchenko obviously knows this kind of position, and he could already foresee his break back on move 13 when we arrived at this structure. Black’s position is desperate due to the creation of new weaknesses. The most immediate threat is hxg6 winning the bishop on h6. }
29... Bg7
{ It is impossible to keep lines closed with  29...g5  due to  30.f4 !   or  30.Re3 !?  followed by  Rf3  with a huge advantage  30...gxf4  31.Rf1  Qe7  32.Bxf4  Bxf4  33.Rxf4  with a massive advantage due to Black’s weaknesses and exposed king. }
30. Bxg7 Kxg7 31. Re5
{ Not the strongest, but conceptually correct and certainly good enough.   A more direct, but rather complicated, win could be obtained after:  31.hxg6 !  hxg6   or  31...Qxg6  32.Qa3 !  threatening  Qe7  or Re5-h5 with a devastating attack, for example:  32...Qxg4  33.Qe7+  Kg8  34.Qxh7+  Kf8  35.Qh8+ !  Qg8   35...Ke7 ?  36.Rh7+  Kd6  37.Qe5#  36.Qf6+  Ke8  37.Rh8  +-  32.Qe3  Qf6   32...Rh8 ?  loses a rook after  33.Qe5+  33.Qh6+  Kf7  34.Re3  Threatening  Rf3  with a crushing attack. }
31... Rc2 32. Qe3 Rf8
{ Threatening ...Qxf2.   Taking the pawn by  32...Rxb2 ?  loses on the spot after:  33.hxg6  hxg6   or  33...Qxg6  34.Rg5  34.Qh6+  Kf6  35.Re3  Threatening  Rf3  , and now  35...Ke7  36.Rf3  Qg8  37.Qg5+  Kd6  38.Rh6  when White’s attack is irresistible. }
33. Bf3 Rxb2 34. hxg6 Qxf3+
{ Going into a technically lost endgame, but there was nothing better to do.   If  34...hxg6  White gets a winning attack. For example,  35.Qh6+  Kf6  36.Rh4  Ke7  37.Rf4  Qg8  38.Qg5+  Kd6  39.Bxd5 !  and wins, since  39...exd5 ?  fails to  40.Qe7+  Kc7  41.Rxf8. }
35. Qxf3 Rxf3 36. Kxf3 hxg6 37. Re2 Rb4 38. Rc2 Ba4
{ Not  38...Rxd4 ?  39.Rc7  and White wins at once. } 39. Rc7+ Kf6 40. Ke3
{ Note how the attack against Black’s king continues; the threat is f2-f4, Rhh7 and Rf7#. }
40... Rb2 41. Rhh7 { Black cannot prevent mate in any sensible way. } 41... g5
{ Or  41...Be8  42.f4  Kf5  43.Kf3  (threatening Rf7)  43...Kf6  44.Rh8  Bb5   44...Bf7  45.Rf8  +-  45.Rf8#. }
42. Rh6+ Kf5 43. f3 g4 44. f4
{ Black resigns due to the checkmating threat with Rf7.  Final remarks  1. Black’s biggest mistake was 11...f6 creating a weak e5-square he would not be able to guard later.  2. White’s plans as exhibited in this game are extremely typical of this structure; they repeat themselves over and over.  3. White’s break h4-h5 was essential in the victory as it forced the creation of a new weakness – the g6-pawn.  4. In retrospect, we realize that having a pawn on g6 should have been a red flag for Black, indicating his position would be bad after 11...f6. Had the pawn been on g7 it would have been harder for White to break on the kingside  (e.g. h4-h5 would not hit anything yet)  . }

15. Ne2

Probably the best defence was the weird-looking  17.Bb5  with the intention to trade off the c6-knight before it becomes a threat.  17...Rf8  18.Bxc6  bxc6  19.Ng3  Chances are approximately balanced, but Black is really the one playing for an advantage.

15... O-O
{ Despite previous mistakes, we reach an interesting and characteristic position for the French Type I structure. Black has an isolani, but unlike those examples we studied in Chapter 1, Black’s d5-pawn is actually a passed pawn. Also unlike Chapter 1, trading pieces or placing a knight on d4 will not help White so much, as we will see in this game. }

17... Rae8 18. Qd2

More precise was  40...Nd5 !  41.Ne1   or  41.Bxd5  Kxd5  42.Ne1  g5  -+ is similar to the game  41...Nc3  42.Nd3+  Kd6  43.Nb2  Ba6  winning the a2-pawn and later the game. }
41. Ne1 Ba6
{ Conceptually correct, but imprecise again.   Better was  41...Be6 !  keeping the advantage, since the line  42.Bg2  Nd5  43.Bxd5  Bxd5  44.f4  gxf4  45.Nd3+  Kd6  46.Nxf4  Be4  favours Black greatly, because after  47.Nd3  Bxd3  48.Kxd3  Ke5  the pawn endgame is winning for Black. }

43. Kd1
{ A fatal waiting move, allowing Black to consolidate his advantage.   White could have saved the game with  43.f4 !  getting rid of the weakness, and after:  43...gxf4  44.Nd3+  Kd6   or  44...Bxd3  45.Kxd3  and it is Black who must be precise now, for example  45...Nd7 ?!  46.Ke4 !  +=  45.Nxf4  The endgame is drawn. }
43... Nd5
{ -+ The threats 44...Nc3 and 44...Nf4 force White to trade his light-squared bishop. }
44. Bxd5 Kxd5
{ White’s pawns on light squares are easy targets for Black’s bishop. The battle is decided and the rest is simple. }
45. Nf3
{ If  45.f3  then  45...Ke5  46.Kd2  Bb5 !  is the most precise, leaving White in zugzwang   but not  46...Bf1  47.Nc2  Bxh3 ?  48.Ke2  when the bishop is trapped  .  47.Nc2  Bf1  48.Ne1  Kf4  49.Nc2  Kxf3  50.Nxd4+  Kf4  51.Nf5  Bxh3  52.Nxh6  Bxg4  -+ }

{ White resigns.   After the line  55.a4  h4  56.a5  h3  57.a6  h2  58.a7  h1=Q  Black’s queen covers the promotion square.  Final remarks  1. Throughout the entire game, White was unable to install a firm blockade against Black’s d5-pawn. In fact, this isolated pawn was never vulnerable.  2. Trading pieces did not favour White; in fact towards the end, the trade of rooks allowed Black to obtain a winning endgame as the d-pawn advanced decisively. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@French Type II@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure primarily arises from the French Defence, especially from versions of the line   1.e4  e6  2.d4  d5  3.Nc3  Nf6  4.e5  Nfd7  5.f4  c5  6.Nf3  Nc6  7.Be3  cxd4  8.Nxd4.  Another common way to obtain this structure is from a typical Sicilian Scheveningen structure  (mentioned in Chapter 22)  , in which Black manages to get in the ...d6-d5 break and White replies with e4-e5. This position is a mirror image of the King's Indian Type III-B studied in Chapter 16, but the character of the game is not quite the same because of the position of the kings  (which typically castle short)  . In this structure White has chances for a mating attack, which he did not have in the structure mentioned before. Despite this difference, other ideas remain the same. For example, White desires to have firm control of d4 and to place a knight on this square  (like the e4-square from Chapter 16)  . Also, the chain reaction f4-f5  (by analogy with c4-c5 in the structure in Chapter 16)  is still strong. The plans for this structure are:  White's plans  1. Control the d4-square, place a knight on d4 and support it with c2-c3, a bishop on e3 and possibly a rook on d1.  2. Attack the base of Black's chain with f4-f5xe6 to later target the e6-pawn.  3. Obtain a kingside attack with f4-f5-f6 together with bringing pieces to the kingside such as Qh5, Rf3-h3, Bd3.  4. Castle long and then pursue a kingside pawn storm with h2-h4-h5, g2-g4-g5, etc.  Black's plans  1. Undermine White's pawn chain with the central break ...f7-f6. This is generally an effective way to draw attention away from White's kingside attack.  2. Undermine White's e5-pawn with ...g7-g5, even as a pawn sacrifice.  3. Simplify the position to decrease the influence of White's spatial advantage and the power of White's attack.  4. Trade the bad bishop  (the light-squared bishop)  or find a way to place it outside the pawn chain, preferably on the b1-h7 diagonal.  5. Pursue a queenside minority attack with ...b7-b5-b4. This plan can be a positional idea to create weaknesses when White castles short, or can be used as an attacking plan if White has castled long.  The first game in this chapter is an example of White's kingside attack, while the second illustrates how Black can neutralize this action with his Plan 1  (the ...f7-f6 break)  . The third example illustrates how bad it can be to have a bad bishop  (with reversed colours)  , while the fourth example showcases Black's strong light-squared bishop on g6, combined with Plan 4. The fifth game in this chapter is an example of opposite-flank attacks once White castles long. This chapter finishes with two short examples. The first of these illustrates Black's Plans 2 and 3 combined, while the last example shows how Black may trade light-squared bishops.  As the reader may notice, whether White castles short or long has an important effect on the nature of the game. Both options are very common, but six out of my seven examples have White castling short for pedagogical reasons. The positions resulting from long castling tend to be very sharp, and tactical complications often dominate over strategic ideas. It is good to know these games with long castling, but one is unlikely to learn strategy from them. For this reason I thought one example should satisfy the curiosity of the readers while giving me the opportunity to show at least some tactical ideas in this position. }

12. dxc5
{ Another typical move is  12.Qf2 !?  forcing Black to define the centre with  12...cxd4   or  12...c4 !?  13.Nxd4  Nxd4  14.Bxd4  O-O  15.b4 !?  += which is similar to the game. }
12... Nxc5 13. b4
{ This is a good positional decision, driving the knight away and fixing the queenside structure on a6 and b5. In some cases pushing b2-b4 could be weakening, especially to the c2-pawn, but here there is nothing to worry about, as White’s position is rock solid. }
13... Nd7
{ If  13...Nxd3  14.cxd3  O-O  15.Rac1  Rfc8  16.Qf2  += White has good control of the dark squares, while the bad bishop on  b7  is really bad. }
14. Ne2
{ A natural move, heading towards d4, but probably not the most precise.   Black experiences some difficulties after  14.Qf2 !  planning to proceed with  Ne2  and  Ned4  and then a kingside attack, but having first prevented the manoeuvre  ...Nb6-c4.  Now a possible reaction is:  14...f6 !?   the tempting  14...Nxb4 ?  15.axb4  Qxc3  fails due to  16.f5 !  ± when White obtains a strong attack.   while  14...O-O  15.Ne2  += is similar to the game  15.Nd4  Nxd4  16.Bxd4  O-O  17.Qh4   17.Qe3 !?  +=  17...g6  18.Qh3 !  f5  19.g4 !?  += }
14... Nb6 15. Ned4 Nc4 16. Qe1 Nxe3
{ This is a very poor decision in my opinion. Black clarifies the situation in the centre and gives White a free hand to carry out a kingside attack with f4-f5.   The right continuation was  16...O-O  17.g4  Nxd4  18.Bxd4  a5  when Black has good queenside counterplay since  19.f5  is met by  19...exf5  20.gxf5  f6 !  with an unclear position. }
17. Qxe3
{ This is a good moment to assess the position. White is better for the following reasons:  1. He has undisputed control of the d4-square.  2. Black’s bad bishop is completely locked in by his pawns.  3. White may create a kingside attack, while Black cannot advance on the queenside.  4. The pressure on e6 prevents Black from one of his typical plans – the break ...f7-f6. }
17... g6 18. c3
{ Launching an attack with  18.g4  is a little premature due to  18...h5 !  19.h3  Nxd4  20.Nxd4  hxg4  21.hxg4  Rh4  with an unclear position. }
18... O-O
{ Black is basically inviting White to begin his kingside attack, as he has probably underestimated how strong it will actually be.   It was probably better to play  18...h5 !?  delaying the kingside attack, but now White can direct his attention to the queenside with  19.a4  += or play  19.g3 !?  to slowly build a kingside attack after h2-h3, g3-g4, etc. }
19. g4 { Everything is ready to continue with f4-f5. } 19... Nxd4 20. Nxd4
{ This move is conceptually correct, as the knight and rook support the break f4-f5. Unfortunately, it misses a stronger continuation, and allows a strong reply, as we shall see.   Stronger was  20.cxd4 !  when Black has nothing better than  20...f5  to prevent f4-f5   if  20...Rfc8  21.f5  Qc3  22.h4 !  White gains a crushing attack, for example  22...Bf8  23.fxe6  fxe6  24.h5  Bh6  25.Qxh6  Qxd3  26.hxg6  Qxg6  27.Qxg6+  hxg6  28.Ng5  but after  21.exf6  Rxf6  22.Ne5  ± White has a stable positional advantage, which is similar to the game Areshchenko – Vovk from the previous chapter. }

But instead, after  20...Kh8  White has the simple  21.Rac1  protecting the c3-pawn and preparing an attack with h2-h4-h5. Black does not have much to do, for example  21...Rac8  22.h4  Rfe8   22...Bxh4 ?  23.g5  +-  23.h5  Bf8  24.Kg2  Bg7  25.Rh1  ± with a crushing attack.

24. Rxf5 f6 25. e6 Rg8 26. Rh5
{ Black resigns due to the imminent checkmate.  Final remarks  1. Although White’s move 13.b4 seems like a positional mistake  (it creates a weak c4-square, and turns c2 into a backward pawn)  this move is thematic in this position and it works well to cover the c5-square and fix Black’s queenside structure. This prevents Black from playing ...b5-b4 and ...a6-a5, thus keeping Black’s bishop on b7 locked out of the game.  2. Black’s biggest mistake was 16...Nxe3 which allowed White some extra support for his e5-pawn, to later push f4-f5 optimally.  3. The reader should remember Black’s reaction ...exf5 followed by ...f6 ! to stop White’s attack in the note 16...O-O.   4. Once White achieves the f4-f5 break under optimal conditions, there is essentially nothing Black can do to prevent a deadly mating attack. A reason for White’s success in this game was his control of the d4-square and Black’s inability to use his bishop on b7. In practical terms, White had an extra piece for the attack, and thus it comes as no surprise that his attack was a success. }

48. Rc1 Kg6 49. Rc6+
{ An amusing variation occurs after:  49.Kg1  Kf5+  50.Kf1 ?  Hoping to get the king out of corner, but now  50...Rg2  51.Bd2  Nf6 !  and White’s position collapses since  52.Rxc7  Ng4  wins the f2-pawn to promote the f3-pawn, because  53.Be1 ?  Nh2#  is the end. }
49... Kf7 50. Rh6
{ White cannot really hope for active play without the cooperation of his bishop, but the ”waiting strategy” was also hopeless. If White passively waits with  50.Rc2  then Black has many winning plans.

50... Ra8
{ Black has had a winning position for a while, but this is just the moment when White’s position collapses. }
51. Rh7+ Kg6 52. Rh4 Nf6 { Or:  52...Ra1 !?  53.Rg4+  Kf5  54.Rg1  Rb1  -+ }
53. Bb4 Kg5 54. Rf4 Ra1+ 55. Kh2 Ng4+
{ White resigns.   56.Kh3  loses to  56...Rh1+  57.Kg3  Rg1+  58.Kh3  Nxf2+  59.Kh2  Rg2#   and  56.Rxg4+  is hopeless after  56...Kxg4.  Final remarks  1. This game was a fine illustration of how a strong knight can dominate a bad bishop. In fact, White’s bishop did not do anything useful throughout the entire game.  2. From this example, the reader should learn to treat the bad bishop as a serious problem and find the first opportunity to trade it or make use of it. In this game, White was probably too careless to realize that 22.Ba3 could secure equality, while 22.Bd2 would lock the bishop inside the pawn chain permanently.  3. From Black’s play, the pawn sacrifice 36...h4 followed by 40...g5 was simply superb, as White cannot survive once the position becomes open. }

The fact that Black’s bishop was on the h7-b1 diagonal played a key role throughout the game. The main thing to notice is how White could not carry out his standard f4-f5 break because this bishop was ideally placed to prevent it. Instead he had to settle for the far less effective h2-h4-h5 plan which ultimately backfired.  2. Black’s queenside counterplay with ...b5-b4 was also a significant obstacle to White’s attack, forcing him to hurry up in his kingside actions. Black probably should have kept an eye on the possible 27.c4 ! and in retrospect it could have been better to play 22...b4 opening the queenside at once.  3. If we observe the later stages of the game, we see how Black’s supposedly bad bishop actually combines attack and defence in an excellent fashion. In contrast, White’s bad bishop on f2 really is a bad piece and contributes nothing to the battle. }

{ This natural-looking move is actually a near-decisive mistake for Black. I presume he was not familiar with the attacking scheme White intended to use.   A safer alternative was  16...Nc5 !  intending to trade off some pieces to reduce White’s attacking chances:  17.Nxc5  Bxc5  18.Qf2  Bxd4  19.Qxd4  With an approximately balanced game.

For example,  17...Bb7  18.g5  Bc6  19.h5  Bxa4  20.Bxh7+ !  with a winning attack; this is very similar to the game.  17...a5  18.Kb1  a4  19.Nbc1  Ba6  Black’s attack arrives first, for example  20.g5  Rfc8  21.h5  Nxb2 !  with a crushing attack. }

White’s attacking scheme – Bxh7 followed by g5-g6 and h5-h6 – has an effectiveness of pretty much 100%. Black should avoid it at all costs by running faster on the queenside or trading pieces with ...Nc5 before it is too late. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@How Black trades his light-squared bishop@@HeaderEnd@@  A recurring question in this structure is how Black should make use of his light-squared bishop. In the earlier example Van Wely – Karjakin, we saw how useless this bad bishop can be, while the game Maze – Ni Hua was an example of this bishop’s potential outside the pawn chain. The latter example came from a line of the Caro-Kann Defence in which Black automatically gets his bishop outside the chain on move 3. Since Black does not achieve this in the French Defence, what should he make of this bishop? In many cases the best approach is to trade it with the typical ...b7-b6 and ...Ba6. Here is an example: }

Then the moves ...Be7-b4xc3 simplified the position to obtain a fight between Black’s strong knight and White’s bad bishop. White should have realized his kingside attack was unlikely to work, especially since his dark-squared bishop was incapable of contributing.  The reader should remember how Black can trade his light-squared bishop  (with ...Ba6)  and how poor White’s attack is without the right minor pieces – for example, without his light-squared bishop, or without a sufficient number of pieces. }

[White "French Type III"]
[Black "Introduction"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@French Type III@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure will most typically arise from the Advance Variations of the French or the Caro-Kann but it can also be obtained from other openings, such as the Catalan after   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  e6  3.Nf3  d5  4.g3  Be7  5.Bg2  O-O  6.O-O  c6  7.Qc2  Nbd7  8.Nbd2  b6  9.e4  Bb7  10.e5  There is a strong similarity between the French Type Ill structure and the King's Indian Type III, which we studied in Chapter 16, which is a mirror version of this structure. Both in that structure and this one, there will be a fight on opposite flanks based on chain operations. White will want to hit near the base of Black's chain, the e6-pawn, with f2-f4-f5, while Black will try the same with ...c7-c5.  Similarly to the analogy we made in the previous chapter, there is one major difference between this structure and Chapter 16, and it is the location of the kings. In Chapter 16, Black was likely to play ...f7-f5-f4 gaining kingside space and therefore having chances for an attack. In contrast, it is White who has attacking chances in this structure because of his e5-pawn. Most likely Black will castle short, though we will also consider the case where Black decides to castle long.  Since this is a closed position, the colour of the bishops will play a significant role. Following the general rule, White's dark-squared bishop and Black's light-squared bishop will be considered 'bad'. But in practice, White's spatial advantage allows him to make good use of his dark-squared bishop. Even from c1, this bishop can prove helpful in a kingside attack. In contrast, if Black's bishop is on its initial square c8, it is likely to be a terrible piece, which is similar to what we learned in the game Van Wely - Karjakin from the previous chapter  (with reversed colours)  . On the other hand, if the black bishop is on f5 or g6, then it's a different story.  Now, let's discuss specific plans.  White's plans  1. Attack the base of Black's pawn chain with f2-f4-f5-fxe6.  2. Create a powerful kingside attack with f2-f4-f5-f6 followed by mate threats on the g7-square.  3. Attack Black's kingside with rooks along the third rank, a bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal, and a queen typically placed on h5. A piece sacrifice on the kingside is also likely to work well.  Black's plans  1. Attack the base of the chain, White's d4-pawn, with ...c7-c5xd4, ...Nc6, ...Qb6. In some cases use major pieces to invade along the c-file.  2. Advance ...c7-c5-c4, and then attack the new base of the chain  (the c3-pawn)  with ...b7-b5-b4. This plan can be too slow if White has good attacking chances on the kingside.  3. Trade light-squared bishops on the ^fl-a6 diagonal  (say with ...b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6)  or make good use of this bishop along the h7-b1 diagonal.  4. Slow down White's kingside attack with ...f7-f5, or even fight for counterplay with the more confrontational ...f7-f6.  White's Plans 1 and 2 are very effective while the centre remains firmly closed. The pawn chain and the spatial advantage prevent Black from effectively manoeuvring and defending the kingside. This allows White's checkmating attack and even piece sacrifices to work very well. For this reason Black must find a way to break in the centre or slow down the attack with either Plan 1 or Plan 4, that is ...c7-c5, ...f7-f6, or ...f7-f5.  White's Plan 3  (a kingside attack using pieces more than pawns, particularly a bishop on d3)  is not one I will cover in much detail in this chapter. Tactics will dominate, so it is not a good fit for my purposes. The extreme example is the Greek Gift - the bishop sacs on h7, then a knight check on g5 and queen to h5. All great fun and still winning a few points in the 21st century, but a topic for another day.  Black's Plan 1 can be very effective if White is unable to defend the d4-pawn or unable to cover the c2-square, which is the entry point for Black's rooks. If White can protect both these points well, then this plan can be a big disappointment, since the capture ...cxd4 means Black no longer has a queenside break to execute. Meanwhile White can proceed with his desired kingside attack. Something to note about Black's Plan 2 is that this plan is rather slow, and therefore it is far more likely to work well if Black has castled long, away from White's kingside play. In such a case, this plan can also be combined with a potential kingside attack based on ...f7-f6, ...g7-g5 and so on.  The first game in this chapter illustrates how White is able to give up control of the c-file and still have a good position as long as he can control Black's entry points  (the c2- and c1-squares)  . White then proceeds with his standard f4-f5 plan.  The second example illustrates a particular type of plan that is not always relevant to this structure  (and partly for that reason I did not mention it in the list above)  but is important if Black's light-squared bishop is exchanged on g6. Then once Black has recaptured with ...hxg6, White can go for an h4-h5 break and subsequent kingside attack.  The third game is an example of Black's Plan 4 while the fourth game is a combination of Black's Plans 2 and 4. Then the last game brings together many of Black's ideas into one elegant example. }

{ After an unusual start, we have reached the thematic structure. The reader should begin by assessing the position. Who is better? One of my students said, ”Black’s obviously better, as he dominates the c-file, and has a strong knight on c4.” Then I asked, ”How exactly do you make use of the c-file?” and suddenly he began to hesitate. When I first studied this game I thought White had to fight for equality, but this superficial evaluation was simply wrong. After a long analysis, I concluded Black is already in very serious trouble, as he cannot create serious threats on the queenside. Black’s position looks okay, to say the least, but there aren’t real entry points down the c-file, since the c2-square is protected. In addition, White does not have any weakness on the queenside.   Then, why should White be better in this position? White’s advantage is a result of his space, his ability to protect the c2-square and the d4-pawn. In addition, Black’s kingside was weakened by ...g7-g6, which does not mix well with the e6-d5 chain by weakening dark squares and allowing White to break with h4-h5. }
21... Qd7
{ To double rooks on the c-file, as there is not really anything better to do.   If  21...a5 ?!  planning to follow with  ...a5-a4-a3  to create some targets in White’s queenside, then  22.a4 !  threatens b2-b3 trapping the knight, and after  22...Bf8  23.Rc2   but not  23.b3 ?!  Na3  24.Rea2  Qc3  with counterplay  23...Qb7  24.b3  Na3  25.Rca2  ± followed by  Rxa3  gaining two pieces for a rook.   An interesting attempt is to play:  21...b5 !?  If White simply continues his play on the kingside with  22.h5 ?!   Instead, it is best for White to first gain partial control of the c-file with  22.Rc2  Qd7  23.Rac1  Bf8  24.Bf1  += and only now continue with a pawn storm against Black’s king.  22...b4  23.f4  a5  24.Bf1  a4  25.Be1  Bf8  26.Qd3  then Black can obtain interesting counterplay with:  26...b3 !?   but not  26...a3 ?  27.b3  Nb2  28.Qe3  ± when Black’s counterplay runs out of fuel  27.a3  Rab8  28.Rh2  Bxa3 !?  Sacrificing a piece to create a passed pawn on the b-file, and now  29.hxg6  fxg6  30.bxa3  b2  31.Rb1  Rb3  with an unclear position. }
22. h5
{ += This marks the beginning of a good plan; Granda Zuniga understands it will take a long while before Black’s doubled rooks on the c-file can create any serious threats, so he begins a kingside expansion immediately.   If White chooses to advance his pawns in a different order with  22.f4 ?!  then  22...h5 !  makes it difficult to continue advancing optimally. }
22... Rc7
{ Most humans would not like to play  22...gxh5 ?!  as it weakens the kingside pawn structure permanently. A good continuation would be:  23.f4  Rc6   23...f5 ?!  only makes matters worse after  24.exf6  Bxf6  25.Qd3  ± followed by  Rae1  and  Bh3  pressuring the e6-pawn  24.Qd3  Rac8  25.f5 !  += With the positional threat of f5-f6. The pawn cannot be captured with  25...exf5 ?  due to  26.Bh3  followed by  Bxf5  , when Black’s pawn structure is simply destroyed. }
23. f4 Rac8
{ Black has doubled rooks on the c-file, but how will he continue? } 24. Bf1
{ The bishop on g2 was rather useless, and this move has two purposes:  1. To clear the second rank for a future transfer Re2-f2 to support g3-g4 and f4-f5.   2. To prepare a future Bf1-d3 to attack the kingside along the b1-h7 diagonal. }
24... Bf8
{ Black’s inferiority becomes apparent, as the rooks are doubled on the c-file but there is no clear-cut path to creating threats.   If  24...Qb5  simply  25.Rc2 !?  += followed by  Bd3  with an excellent position for White. }
25. Be1
{ This move is not really about preventing ...Bf8-b4, but rather about clearing the second rank to continue with g3-g4, Re2-f2 and f4-f5. }
25... b5 26. Qd3
{ Covering the e3-square to release the rook.   But not  26.Rf2 ?  Ne3  27.Qd3  Nxf1  28.Rxf1  Rc4  =+ when Black’s queenside play begins to work. }
26... Nb6
{ Preparing ...Rc7-c1.   By now it is too late to start pushing queenside pawns with  26...b4  since White’s kingside attack arrives first, for example:  27.g4  a5  28.f5  g5  Hoping to keep lines closed.  29.Rf2  a4  30.Qf3  ± Followed by  Bd3  with multiple threats. }
27. b3 { This move prevents Black’s knight from coming into the game again. }
27... Rc1
{ Black’s ”invasion” down the c-file will be short lived.   If Black just waited with  27...a6  then  28.g4  ± followed by  Rf2  and f4-f5 with a strong attack. }
28. Rxc1 Rxc1 29. Bd2
{ Simple and effective; the rook on c1 has nothing to do, so it is forced to retreat. }
29... Rc7
{ 29...Ra1 ?  is bad because of  30.Bc3  Rc1  31.Qd2  Rb1  32.Qc2  and the rook is trapped.   Similarly, if  29...Rd1 ?  then  30.Qc2  Ra1  31.Bc3  and wins. }
30. Rf2 { Attacking the b5-pawn and preparing g3-g4 and f4-f5. } 30... a6
{ If Black plays  30...Nc8  White does not even have to bother capturing the b5-pawn, but instead can continue attacking with  31.g4  Ne7  32.f5 !  exf5  33.gxf5  Nxf5  34.Bh3  winning, since the capture  Bxf5  will fatally expose Black’s king. }
31. g4 Nc8 32. f5
{ Achieving the typical f4-f5 break against Black’s pawn chain. White’s positional and tactical attack is simply irresistible. }

38. Bg4 { There is no defence against Rh2 and Qh3. } 38... Qc6 39. Rh2 Bg7 40.
fxg7 f5 41. Rh8+ Kxg7 42. Qh3
{ Final remarks  1. White was able to win this game because he understood that the structure transformation on moves 17 and 21 was favourable to him. The key was his ability to protect c2 and d4.  2. Black was left without a plan because he could not make use of the c-file and because it was not even worthwhile to attack the well-supported d4-pawn. There are no other plans for Black to try in this position.  3. White’s kingside attack rolls on very easily, but Granda Zuniga’s play on moves 22-30 is worthy of praise. White’s forces were ideally synchronized to neutralize Black’s play while preparing the f4-f5 break. }

Now that we understand how the structure affects the plans, we proceed with the game. }

Final remarks  1. The capture 10...hxg6 changed the nature of the position, as the h4-h5 break became stronger than the typical f4-f5 break.  2. Black’s biggest problem was an incorrect positional evaluation. White’s d4-pawn was well protected, and the plan ...c5-c4, ...b7-b5-b4 was far too slow against White’s h4-h5 break. If Black had realized this opposite-flank race was lost, he probably would have played 11...Qc7 in order to castle long.  3. In retrospect, I believe 14...f6 was a reasonable option. It certainly looks terrible as the pawns on e6, f6 and g6 make a very vulnerable team. However, by trading the e5-pawn White’s attacking chances are reduced and Black manages to stay in the game for longer. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@Sergei Zhigalko – Julian Radulski, Warsaw 2010@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game illustrates how Black may effectively carry out the ...c5-c4 plan, subsequently castling long and creating a kingside attack. }
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. a3
{ To play b2-b4, forcing Black to release the tension on d4. } 6... c4
{ Now let’s see how the game continued. } 7. Nbd2 Na5 8. Be2 Bd7 9. O-O
{ Over the last couple of years the move  9.Rb1 !?  has become more popular, as White wants to open the b-file to have an attack once Black castles queenside. Recent games have continued with:  9...Ne7   but  9...Qc7 !?  is enough to prevent b2-b4 for the moment, obtaining a position similar to the game  10.b4  cxb3  11.Nxb3  The b-file is open, and now if Black attempts to win an exchange with  11...Ba4  then simply:  12.Nxa5 !  Qxa5   or  12...Bxd1 ?!  13.Rxb6  axb6  14.Bb5+  Kd8  15.Nxb7+  Kc7  16.Kxd1  Kxb7  17.Ng5  += as in the game Rapport – Apicella, France 2013  13.Qd2  b5  14.Bd3  a6  15.O-O  Rc8  16.Qe2  h6  17.Bd2  With a fighting position as in the game Duda – Wang Yiye, Al-Ain 2013. }
9... Ne7 10. Rb1 Qc7 11. Ne1
{ Opening the b-file with  11.b4 ?  no longer works due to:  11...cxb3  12.Nxb3  Ba4  ∓   Another possible plan was  11.Re1  Nc8  12.Nf1  Nb6  13.Bf4  Ba4  14.Qc1  Nb3  15.Qe3  when Black’s king will be safe on the queenside but White will expand on the kingside anyway. However, the game will not be ”one-sided” as White’s kingside attack may become dangerous to his own king. Overall, chances are approximately equal as in the game Nakamura – Pelletier, Biel 2005. }
11... O-O-O 12. Bg4 Kb8 { But now: } 13. Nc2
{ This is not the best way to proceed.   13.f4  was a better alternative, and after  13...g6  14.Ndf3  Bg7  15.Bh3  the position is complicated, but chances are approximately balanced. White must expand on the kingside with extreme care, so as not to allow strong counterplay. For example,  15...Rdg8  16.g4 ?  would certainly be a premature decision, since now  16...h5 !  gives Black an excellent game. }
13... Ba4
{ A good and rather thematic move. This bishop permanently prevents White from obtaining queenside play, and now it also makes White’s manoeuvres more difficult due to the pin. }
14. Nf3
{ To illustrate why the pin is annoying, notice that the normal  14.f4  can now be met by  14...h5 !?  15.Bh3   not  15.Bxh5 ?  Bxc2  16.Qxc2  Rxh5  and wins  15...Nf5  16.Nf3  Be7  with a good game for Black. }
14... Nc8 15. Qe2 Nb6
{ This knight transfer is very typical of the position; it reinforces the control of the queenside, and may help in a future expansion. The position is critical and White needs to find the right way to react on the kingside. }
16. h4
{ But this is not it, as we shall see.   It was better to play  16.Ng5 !?  improving the knight:  16...h6  17.Nh3  Be7  18.Nf4 !?   or  18.f4 !?  with a normal position  (Now the knight is pretty good on f4, as it makes it difficult for Black to play ...f7-f5)  (or ...f7-f6)  (and helps prepare a slow-paced kingside expansion with g2-g3 and h2-h4-h5.) }
16... Ka8
{ This is a normal move, but it misses a stronger continuation.   A strong option was:  16...f5 !  17.Bh3   Or  17.exf6  gxf6  when Black can soon develop an unpleasant kingside initiative. The e6-pawn is untouchable since  18.Bxe6 ?  loses to  18...Re8  followed by  ...Bd7.  17...h6  Black will continue with  ...Be7  ,  ...Rdg8  and  ...g5  with an extremely powerful kingside attack. }
17. h5
{ White does not realize how many problems he is about to face. In fact, this move makes Black’s reaction even stronger, as the h5-pawn will become a target.   Again  17.Ng5  would have prevented Black’s strong kingside reaction with  ...f7-f5  and after  17...h6  18.Nh3  g6  19.Bf4  the game is approximately balanced. }
17... f5
{ A wonderful move! A double exclamation mark is not an exaggeration: the move is both strong and nearly decisive. This is a reaction the reader should never forget: by using a tactical resource, Black achieves the ...f7-f5 push, after which he dominates the game for the following reasons:  1. He clearly controls the queenside; he has nothing to fear on this flank.  2. He can now begin to expand on the kingside with an eventual ...g7-g5.   3. He can easily create an attack against White’s king.  4. White is inferior on both flanks, hence he cannot create counterplay. }
18. Bh3
{ It is probably better to take on  f6  , in order to prevent Black’s kingside expansion with  ...g7-g5  , but in this case  18.exf6  gxf6  does not really help White either, since his position is so weakened:  19.Re1   not  19.Bxe6 ?  Re8  -+ followed by  ...Bd7  19...Re8  20.Bh3  Bd6  21.Ne3  Qf7  ∓ Black is about to create a strong attack down the g-file, and the h5-pawn is falling.   If  18.Ng5  fxg4  19.Nxe6  Qd7  20.Nxd8  Qxd8  ∓ the two pieces are far stronger than a rook in this position. }
18... Qf7 { Attacking the weak h5-pawn. } 19. Ng5
{ If  19.h6  gxh6  Black is simply a pawn up, as the doubled h-pawns are quite useful. For example:  20.g3  Rg8  21.Kh2  Bxc2  22.Qxc2  Be7  23.Qe2   23.Bxh6 ?  loses a piece to  23...Qh5  23...Bg5  24.Rg1  Rdf8  ∓ With threats such as  ...f5-f4  or  ...Nb3. }
19... Qg8 20. Bf4 h6 21. Nf3 Qf7
{ Even stronger was  21...Bxc2 !  22.Qxc2  Qf7  winning the h5-pawn and the game after  23.g3  Qxh5  24.Bg2  g5. }
22. Nfe1 Rg8 23. Kh1 Be7 24. Ne3
{ White is struggling to manoeuvre, having little space.   More stubborn was  24.Bh2  Rdf8  25.f4  but after  25...g5  26.hxg6  Qxg6  ∓ White remains in deep trouble. }
24... Rdf8
{ Preparing ...Be8 and ...Qxh5.   The premature  24...Be8  is answered by  25.g4  fxg4  26.Qxg4  though Black preserves an advantage after:  26...g5 !  27.Bh2  Qh7 !?  ∓ }
25. Bh2 Be8 26. g4
{ Making things easier for Black.   The last attempt was  26.f4  Qxh5  27.g4 !  since after  27...Qxh3   or  27...Qg6 !?  ∓  the queen gets trapped:  28.Rf3  Qh4  29.N1g2  But even so Black is better after  29...fxg4  30.Nxh4  gxf3  31.Nxf3  g5  ∓ with the strong threat of  ...Bg6-e4. }
26... f4 27. N3c2 f3 28. Qd1 g6 { Black opens the kingside decisively. } 29.
hxg6 Qxg6 30. Rg1 { 30.Nxf3  doesn’t help due to  30...Rxf3  31.Qxf3  Qxc2. }
30... Ba4 { All of White’s forces are tied up. } 31. g5
{ Other choices are no better.   For example:  31.Rg3  Bh4  32.Rxf3  Bxf2  33.Rxf8+  Rxf8  34.Qe2  Bxe1  -+ }
31... hxg5
{ The h-file will be fatal for White; he simply does not have sufficient space to reorganize his forces. }
32. Rg3 Rh8 33. Bg4 Rh4 34. Rc1 Qe4 35. Bxf3 Qh7
{ White had to resign.  Final remarks  1. The ...c5-c4 advance by Black had to be combined with long castling, and works especially well if White is unable to open the b-file with b2-b3.   2. Once Black has castled long, White may still expand on the kingside, but there is a chance this plan could backfire as White’s king can now become exposed.  3. Black’s 17th move ...f5 was an extremely strong blow. If Black manages to combine ...c5-c4 with the ...f7-f5 advance, then he has obtained a significant spatial advantage and White is in serious trouble all over the board. It is no surprise that Black was able to win easily afterwards, as there is little White can do to prevent Black’s active kingside play based on the ...g7-g5 expansion. }

{ Final remarks  This game brought together many of the ideas learned throughout this chapter. Black did not capture with 13...cxd4 as the first game in the chapter showed us the c-file is not useful if the entry points are covered, as was the case here. Later, Black implemented the ...f7-f6 break to gain counterplay along the f-file and to prevent White from further advance, in similar style to Gopal – Bologan.  The ...f7-f6 break combined with having a bishop along the h7-b1 diagonal meant Black was able to stop White’s kingside play altogether. This gave him time to pursue the complete chain-advance plan. The advance ...c5-c4 turned the c3-pawn into the base, while the advance ...b4-b3 turned White’s b2-pawn into the base of the chain. The b2-pawn was harder to defend than the c3-pawn, which in turn was harder to defend than the d4-pawn. Since Black had time, he decided to go after the b2-pawn and he succeeded. This game was a beautiful illustration of these concepts. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The 3-3 vs. 4-2 Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  The 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure is very common. It typically arises from the Caro-Kann or Slav structures studied in Chapters 3 and 4. In the Caro-Kann we obtain this structure once Black plays ...c5 and White captures dxc5. In the Slav it occurs after Black plays ...e5 and White replies dxe5. Note that in the second case we reach this structure with reversed colours. This structure may also arise from the Scheveningen Sicilian, as we will discuss later in this chapter. The fact that this position is open allows for massive piece exchanges and it is quite common for players of all levels to agree to a draw upon arriving at this structure, just because of its seemingly drawish nature. Nevertheless, both sides have some ambitious plans.  White's plans  1. Control the d-file and use it for a seventh-rank invasion if possible.  2. Pursue a majority attack. That is, advance the queenside pawns to create a passed pawn.  Black's plans  1. Control the d-file and use it for a seventh-rank invasion if possible.  2. Pursue a minority attack with ...a7-a5 and ...b7-b5-b4. If this plan is successful Black will probably eliminate White's a-, b-, and c-pawns using his a- and b-pawns. Thereupon Black will attempt to win an endgame with 4 vs. 3 kingside pawns.  Something to note is that both sides play on the queenside. This is quite logical since in the majority of cases the kings will be castled on the kingside. Attempting a kingside attack in such an open position is quite likely to backfire for either side. Of course there are exceptions to this rule, and an attack could succeed if pieces are already actively placed when we reach this structure. Nevertheless, I would not recommend starting a kingside attack from scratch as the opponent is likely to find a refutation in the centre or on the queenside.  Something to be aware of is that because this structure is quite open, the pair of bishops tends to be more important here than in other structures studied in this book. Overall, this structure is quite simple strategically speaking, but it is by no means drawish, and it is good to know how to proceed with either side. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Panov Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  When you see the name 'Panov Structure' you might guess IQP, but instead I shall give this name to the structure you can see above, which usually originates from the Panov variation of the Caro-Kann after   1.e4  c6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  cxd5  4.c4  Nf6  5.Nc3  Nc6  6.Nf3  when White later plays c4-c5.  This structure may also arise from the Queen's Indian Defence, as well as any position with a Carlsbad structure.  White's plans  The main plan is clear: create a passed pawn on the queenside. If White is able to play b2-b4-b5 and later c5-c6, then he is likely to have a big advantage.  Black's plans  Black can counter this plan with two different approaches:  1. Attack the front of White's chain  (the c5-pawn)  with ...b7-b6. This is done in order to trade the c5-pawn, eliminating White's most dangerous threat.  2. Attack the base of the chain  (the d4-pawn)  by placing a knight on c6 and a bishop on f6. This is often combined with playing ...f7-f5 and placing a strong knight on e4.  Black's Plans 1 and 2 can often be combined effectively. Overall the Panov structure is a relatively simple one, though we should know its basic plans. Here I present a couple of short fragments to illustrate how White creates a passed pawn, how Black fights for counterplay, and then we finish our discussion with an example of how a Carlsbad structure is converted into a Panov. }

{ Final remarks  1. Black’s biggest mistake was accepting a Panov structure without counterplay. It was necessary to realize that neither ...b7-b6 nor attacking the d4-pawn would work well.  2. The reader should notice how Black essentially had no useful moves while White could advance his queenside majority and prepare the creation of a passed pawn. Also, it is noteworthy that White did not just push c5-c6 as soon as it became possible. Rather, it is important to prepare this move so that the pawn will not become stuck on c6, unable to advance further. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Dragon Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Dragon Formation arises almost exclusively from the Dragon or Accelerated Dragon lines of the Sicilian. It may also occur with reversed colours when White plays the English Opening and Black replies with 1...e5 followed by 2...Nf6 and 3...d5. Assuming we have the structure with colours the usual way around  (say, from a Dragon)  then Black almost always castles short while White must choose whether to castle short or long. This decision has a significant influence on the character of the resulting game.  White's plans  1. If White castles long, then he will assault Black's kingside with h2-h4-h5, and then attempt a mating attack along the h-file.  2. If White castles short, then he will play a central strategy, place a rook on the d-file and a knight on d5.  Black's plans  1. If White castles long, then Black must create a queenside attack at all costs. Black will often play along the c-file as well as push his a- and b-pawns. An exchange sacrifice ...Rxc3, with the idea of doubling pawns, is often possible.  2. If White castles short, then Black can play a more positional game along the c-file. Place a knight on c4, and again the idea of an exchange sacrifice with ...Rxc3 may be possible.  Something to note about White's Plan 2 is that if Black captures the knight on d5 with a piece, and White recaptures with exd5, then the structure is very similar to the asymmetric transformation of the Maroczy, which we studied in Chapter 11.  After such a brief overview, many readers may wonder if the infamous Dragon is really that simple. The truth is that this structure often yields extremely complex positions, but the complexity is mostly tactical. There are few strategic elements to discuss, as most games are decided by brutal tactical shots. This is the reason I decided not to give a separate chapter to this structure. Nevertheless, one interesting idea in this structure is Black's exchange sacrifice on c3, and we will see an example of it. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Scheveningen Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  The Scheveningen structure is one of the most exciting and complicated pawn structures in chess. This structure can arise from almost every variation of the Sicilian, such as the Najdorf, Scheveningen, Classical, Paulsen, Taimanov and many other less prominent lines. Of course, this structure also arises very often in the English Opening with colours reversed when Black plays 1...e5 followed by 2...Nf6 and 3...d5.  White's plans  1. Launch a kingside attack with g2-g4-g5, h2-h4-h5 and then break with g5-g6.  2. Play f2-f4-f5 to pressure the e6-pawn and create an attack along the a2-g8 diagonal.  3. Play f2-f4 and then e4-e5 and then later carry out a kingside attack.  Black's plans  1. Achieve the central break ...d6-d5 to release the position and activate his minor pieces.  2. Play along the c-file, and place a knight on c4 to pressure the b2-pawn and undermine White's knight which is typically located on c3.  3. If White has castled long, then carry out a queenside attack with ...b7-b5-b4, ...a7-a5-a4 and then the break ...b4-b3.  4. If White plays f2-f4, in some cases Black can reply ...g7-g5 to fight for the control of the e5-square.  5. In some cases, Black may sacrifice an exchange on c3, in similar style to what we saw in the Dragon structure.  Black will most likely castle short or on some occasions keep the king in the centre. Meanwhile, White's king must choose between long and short castling, which will greatly influence the development of the game. If White castles long, then his main lines plans will be 1 and 2 while Black will most probably focus on Plan 3. Instead, if White castles short, Black will focus on Plan 1 while White can still carry out a kingside attack. White's Plan 3 is more likely to work after short castling, because the rooks would be placed more favourably for this plan.  Structure transformations  This structure can transpose into some of the structures we have studied previously.  1. If Black plays ...d6-d5 and White replies with e4-e5 then we obtain a French Type II structure  (Chapter 15)  .  2. If Black plays ...d6-d5, White captures e4xd5 and Black recaptures with a piece, then we obtain a 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure.  3. If White plays f2-f4-f5, the pressure on e6 may provoke Black to play ...e6-e5 obtaining a Najdorf Type II structure  (Chapter 9)  .  4. On some occasions, White may play c2-c4 arriving at a Hedgehog structure  (Chapter 10)  .  The second structure transformation above is often favourable for Black on a positional level. The reason is that Black often has his b-pawn already on b5, which is the starting point of Black's minority attack, as described earlier in this chapter.  The 4th structure transformation is quite unlikely to work because White typically has his knight on c3 and cannot afford to move it away in order to play c2-c4.  Overall the Scheveningen is a very interesting pawn structure and deserves study. The reason I do not cover it in more detail is because the strategic ideas in this structure are relatively simple while most of its complexity comes from tactical details which do not fit so well with the content of this book. I am a firm believer that the reader needs most help with strategic concepts, as tactical shots can readily be studied using the ever more powerful computer engines. Here we will see only one example of White's attack once Black plays ...d6-d5 with the king still in the centre. Then we will see a brief discussion of Black's Plan 4. }

{ We have reached a very interesting position that deserves some comment. Black has achieved everything one hopes for with the ...g7-g5 break; let’s spell this out:  1. Black has a colossal knight on e5, which essentially dominates the game.  2. Black is able to make good use of two half-open files  (c and g)  while White cannot easily do similar, especially with the d-file so cluttered.  3. White’s e4-pawn is isolated and vulnerable. Meanwhile, the bishop on d3 is close to useless.  Something to note is that Black’s king stayed in the centre, which is by no means a problem. In fact, it is a standard approach in Scheveningen structures, especially after Black has installed a knight on e5, which ensures the safety of the king. Black has a great position, and White blundered just two moves later, so we will leave our analysis at this point, though the reader is encouraged to analyze this position and convince himself of Black’s superiority. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Benko Structure@@HeaderEnd@@  This structure is actually specific to the Benko variation which begins with   1.d4  Nf6  2.c4  c5  3.d5  b5  4.cxb5  a6  5.bxa6  After the a6-pawn drops, Black is a pawn down but has some positional advantages to compensate for it. They are:  1. White has two pawn 'islands', while Black only has one rock-solid group of six pawns.  2. Black will place his rooks on the a- and b-files, pressuring White's a- and b-pawns, preventing their advance.  3. White does not have obvious targets and may have to limit himself to passive play for a long time in order to stabilize his position.  Theory regards the Benko Gambit as being somewhat inferior, and in fact, it is rarely seen at the elite level nowadays. Nevertheless, it is an excellent practical weapon to be used when one absolutely needs to win with Black. Now, a big question is: How should White play?  There are two main strategies to be followed, and they are often combined:  1. White must turn his queenside pawns into a fortress, which most probably will be on b3 and a4, combined with many minor pieces surrounding and defending these pawns.  2. Advance in the centre and obtain a central break with e4-e5 or maybe f4-f5. These ideas are borrowed from the asymmetric Benoni structure from Chapter 12, and they are White's only active plan. That is, White must try one of these breaks sooner or later. If instead White attempts to trade his b-pawn for Black's c5-pawn, then White's a-pawn will hardly be enough to win, as it will be an easy target for Black's pieces. }

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Closed Ruy Lopez@@HeaderEnd@@  The Closed Ruy Lopez structure pictured on the left is one that arises almost exclusively from the Ruy Lopez opening. It is a very interesting structure, but I decided not to have a full chapter about it because it originates from just one opening, and because it is closely related to the King's Indian structures. The nature of this position most closely resembles the King's Indian Type II structure, the only difference being the pawns on c3 vs. c4  (instead of c4 vs. c5)  . This is, in fact, a big difference, as we will see in the typical plans for this position:  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack with g2-g4, Nbd2-f1-g3-f5, sacrifice a piece on f5 if needed.  2. Create a kingside attack with f2-f4, by analogy with Chapter 15.  3. Play on the queenside with b2-b4, a2-a4 and then invade on the a-file or attack one of Black's queenside pawns.  Black's plans  1. Create queenside play with ...a7-a5, ...b7-b5-b4.  2. Expand on the kingside with ...f7-f5-f4 by analogy with Chapters 15 and 16.  A major structural difference between this structure and the King's Indian structures is that in the Ruy Lopez White doesn't have a spatial advantage on the queenside. Still, having a powerful pawn on d5 is always a plus and will allow White to create queenside play on occasion.  Nevertheless, kingside plans are now more significant than ever for White, and it is important to keep them in mind as queenside play will not always work for him. Unlike pretty much all King's Indian-type positions, Black is now likely to succeed by playing actively on the queenside, though the kingside plans remain valid. But often White will pay so much attention to the kingside that Black will opt for queenside plans. For this reason, in many cases, White will first devote his energies to closing the queenside, and only then move on to a kingside attack. }

We have seen similar patterns in Chapter 14. The key is the spatial advantage provided by the d5-pawn and the c6-square. In this game, this is what made it so easy for White to attack the b5-pawn.  2. Black’s biggest mistake was playing the premature 12...c4, permitting the strong 13.b4. This move allowed White to neutralize Black’s queenside play immediately, and later obtain chances for an advantage as the position opened up. }

{ Similarly to the King’s Indian Complex which we studied in Chapter 18, the Lopez Formation is a very flexible structure. The name ‘Lopez Formation’ was introduced by Soltis in the 1970’s and refers to the fact that this structure almost always arises from the Ruy Lopez. In essence, this structure is one in transition. Depending on how White and Black proceed in the centre, this structure will be transformed in one of the following ways:  1. White advances d4-d5 and later c3-c4, obtaining a King’s Indian Type II structure  (Chapter 15)  .  2. White advances d4-d5 and Black replies ...c5-c4, to obtain a Closed Ruy Lopez, which has just been covered.  3. White captures d4xe5  (or d4xc5)  and Black recaptures ...d6xe5  (or ...d6xc5)  , obtaining a typical transformation of the King’s Indian Complex  (Chapter 18)  .  4. Black captures ...e5xd4 and after c3xd4 White proceeds with d4-d5, obtaining an Asymmetric Benoni  (Chapter 12)  .  5. Black captures ...c5xd4 and after c3xd4 White proceeds with d4-d5, obtaining a King’s Indian Type I structure  (Chapter 14)  .  6. Black trades two pawns on d4 with ...c5xd4 followed by ...e5xd4  (or in the other order)  . The resulting position has not been discussed in previous chapters, and here we will see an example of it. }

However, Black’s pieces are arranged so well that it is not clear White will have a long term! Black’s bishop is extremely powerful along the h8-a1 diagonal, pressuring the knight on d4 and the pawn on b2. Meanwhile, White’s bishop on h4 is rather useless and would have been far better placed on b2 or e3.   When Black decides to trade both pawns on d4, he must carefully assess whether he will have enough counterplay to compensate for the weak d6-pawn. In this case, Black has made an excellent choice and in fact, he is already better. }

{ Final remarks  1. The d6-pawn was never a weakness. Instead, the e4-pawn was quite vulnerable, since playing f2-f3 would severely weaken the g1-a7 diagonal.  2. One of White’s biggest problems was not having the dark-squared bishop on b2 or e3, to parry the threats.  3. Black’s counterplay was particularly successful because of White’s poor coordination. The double pawn trade on d4 would not work as well if White could manage to stabilize the position. }

{ We have reached a critical position and it is time to make an assessment. In the long term White should have a huge advantage because the d6-pawn is a weak isolated backward pawn an easy target. However, Black's pieces are arranged so well that it is not clear White will have a long term! Black's bishop is extremely powerful along the h8-a1 diagonal, pressuring the knight on d4 and the pawn on b2. Meanwhile, White's bishop on h4 is rather useless and would have been far better placed on b2 or e3. When Black decides to trade both pawns on d4, he must carefully assess whether he will have enough counterplay to compensate for the weak d6-pawn. In this case, Black has made an excellent choice and in fact, he is already better. }
