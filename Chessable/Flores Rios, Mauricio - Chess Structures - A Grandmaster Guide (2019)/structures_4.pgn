Black’s pieces were ideally placed for the pawn structure, and this played a major role in the development of the game.

The idea of ...d6-d5 followed by ...e5-e4 is typical, but it is only strong after White has already played f3-f4-f5. The reader should remember this theme and remember when it works. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Hedgehog@@HeaderEnd@@  The hedgehog structure is characterized by Black's pawns on a6-b6-d6-e6, covering some central squares and preventing White's forces from approaching, like a real hedgehog does! Advancing several adjacent pawns to the 3rd rank would generally be a bad decision. For example, moving kingside pawns to h6-g6-f6-e6 would be a major positional mistake as it creates multiple weaknesses. Here this is not the case, as the natural arrangement of Black's pieces allows for the pawns to be defended rather easily, while keeping a variety of active plans at hand. White generally has a spatial advantage in the hedgehog, and Black's main plan is to break in the centre with ...d6-d5, or sometimes ...b6-b5. White will typically arrange his pieces to prevent such plans, while keeping the game tense and flexible. Now, let's discuss specific lines of action for each side.  White's plans  l. Break on the queenside with c4-c5.  2. Break on the queenside with b4-b5.  3. Break on the queenside with a4-a5.  4. Pressure the d6-pawn, but only after some pieces have been traded.  Black's plans  l. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5.  2. Break on the queenside with ...b6-b5.  3. Create a kingside attack with ...Kh8, ...Rg8 and ...g7-g5-g4. Or maybe with ...h7-h5-h4-h3.  4. Prepare all the plans above without actually executing any of them until the right opportunity comes.  White's Plans 1 -3 are often based on arranging pieces actively to subsequently open up the queenside. Such action often gives White a big advantage because Black's pieces are not as active due to their limited space. The most common of these breaks is c4-c5, which typically opens the b- and c-files. White's fourth plan is not as easy to implement because the d6-pawn is not always vulnerable. Black will usually have a bishop on e7  (or c7)  which easily protects this pawn from the attack of rooks down the d-file. In addition, the breaks ...b6-b5 and ...d6-d5 are powerful, drawing attention away from this small vulnerability. However, after some pieces are traded, Black's chances of counterplay lose strength, giving more importance to a vulnerable d6-pawn.  If White's bishop is on the f1-a6 diagonal, Black's first plan is the most important. This plan is so strong that White players will devote a great deal of energy to fight against it. In most cases, White will be able to prevent this break, and Black will need a new plan to create counterplay. A popular option is to create kingside threats with the third plan. This plan often yields double-edged positions where a single slip can be very costly for either side. As we will learn in this chapter, if White cannot fight this plan with a queenside reaction, then Black's kingside play will give him an excellent position.  If White's bishop is on g2, then the ...d6-d5 break is much more difficult to carry out, but then Black's second plan  (the ...b6-b5 break)  gains strength. As long as White does not have a bishop on the fl-a6 diagonal, this break is likely to work well. Something to notice is that if White has played g2-g3 and Bg2, then Black's plan of ...Rg8 and ...g7-g5-g4 does not really hit anything, hence it should not be attempted at all.  Finally, something to mention about Black's position is its flexibility. Often White will find ways to prevent or undermine Black's attempts for counterplay. In such cases, Black can often just wait and attempt new plans without damaging his position. In many cases it is better for Black to continue preparing his plans, or to start a new plan than to execute a plan under unfavourable circumstances; this is the essence of the fourth plan.  As the reader may have noticed from the discussion above, a key factor in the hedgehog is whether White's bishop is developed on g2 or stays on the fl -a6 diagonal. We will focus on the latter as I believe it resembles more closely the spirit of the hedgehog structure. The first four games in this chapter will illustrate White's four plans in numeric order. The fifth example will illustrate Black's ...d6-d5 break, while the remaining examples will illustrate what Black may do if this break is not possible. Games 6 and 7 are examples of the ...Rg8 and ...g7-g5-g4 plan; the eighth game is an example of the ...b6-b5 break, while the last game is a fragment illustrating Black's fourth plan - the ability to wait for an opportunity without damaging his position. } 1. -- *

{ The position in this diagram is from the game Kasparov - Kramnik, Botvinnik Memorial 2001. We use this diagram as a starting point to discuss the key strategic elements in this position, from White's perspective:  Piece arrangement  1. White's rooks should be placed on the b- and c-files, ready for any queenside break.  2. The queen should be placed on c1 protecting the rook on b1 from the potential X-ray attack by the queen on b8.  3. The bishop on g1 is needed against the battery ...Qb8 and ...Bc7, attacking h2.  4. The knights on d4 and d3  (or a4)  ideally support White's centre.  Possible breaks  1. White can attempt to break on the queenside with a4-a5, b4-b5 or c4-c5. Any of these would prove effective given White's ideal piece arrangement.  2. Black does not have effective central breaks. The break ...b6-b5 obviously loses a pawn, while the break ...d6-d5 is immediately punished by the typical exd5, followed by c4-c5 with a strong positional advantage. This response should be remembered and will be discussed later in the chapter. } 1. -- *

Black resigned in view of  48...Bb7  49.Rd8  Kg7  50.Rd7  winning the bishop on  b7.  Final remarks  1. The b4-b5 break should not be disregarded despite its anti-positional look. It is true that White gives up control of the c5-square and weakens his a3- and c4-pawns, but these factors did not make much of a difference in this game. On the other hand, the sudden weakness of the b6- and d6-pawns forced Black to give up a pawn.  2. After White had an extra pawn, it was still a little difficult to impose his superiority, as the a3- and c4-pawns were disconnected. Nevertheless, the plan a3-a4-a5 should work well in most cases, especially if White has a dark-squared bishop applying pressure down the g1-a7 diagonal.  3. The variation 18...d5, in which White replies with the thematic 19.exd5 followed by 20.c5, should be carefully examined. This idea presents itself many times in hedgehog positions, and deserves a close study. } *

Rxc8 Bxa6 34. Rc7+ { The rest of this game is irrelevant to our purposes, though White won the game convincingly.  Final remarks  1. White’s early a2-a4-a5 break was very powerful, and Black should revise his poor opening sequence to avoid such an inferior position.  2. After White achieved the a4-a5 break, Black’s main problem was his lack of counterplay and the vulnerability of the a6- and d6-pawns.  3. White missed a major chance to win by not attacking the d6-pawn directly on move 21. The tactics were favourable and the game could have been decided quickly. } *

[Result "*"]

{ Based on the previous examples, it should be clear that White's spatial advantage plays a significant role in hedgehog positions. Most strategy books teach that we should trade pieces when we have less space. Does this mean Black should trade pieces in the hedgehog? The natural reply would be 'Yes' but reality is not as simple, and in many cases the answer is a forthright 'No'. The reason is that Black's chances of counterplay are mostly based on a ...d6-d5 break, which is unlikely to be helpful unless Black can create serious tactical threats. The trading of two, or even one minor piece, severely undermines the potential threat of a ...d6-d5 break. In other words, having traded some minor pieces would give White a more stable centre, hence a lasting positional advantage. } 1. -- *

Generally speaking, protecting the h2-pawn with Bg1 is somewhat healthier than protecting it with Qg1. However, if White wishes to use the queen for this purpose, he certainly should not lose a tempo by playing Qe1-f2-g1 as in the game.  2. Important: White should be ready to meet ...g7-g5 with a c4-c5 break.  3. Once again, after Black accomplishes the ...g5-g4 break, things do not look good for White in practically every variation. } *

This game is an example of Black’s ...b6-b5 break when White’s bishop is placed on g2 rather than the f1-a6 diagonal.  2. Something to understand about this position is that White’s queenside plans are no longer a priority in this position, while a kingside attack is a much more suitable idea.  3. Black’s ...d6-d5 break is now nearly impossible, but as we see in this game, the ...b6-b5 break is quite likely to be accomplished. } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 b6 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. d4 cxd4 6.

{ @@HeaderStart@@John Bartholomew – Timur Gareev, USA 2009@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objectives:  1. This game illustrates how Black can carry out a waiting strategy without damaging his position.  2. Black prepares many plans, and speculates with tactical ideas, but does not carry out any of them.  3. Black requires great calculating ability to carry out this strategy, as one slip can give White an overwhelming initiative, probably through a queenside attack. Both sides must constantly check the consequences of both White’s and Black’s breaks in this structure. } 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Nf6 7. N1c3 a6 8. Na3 Be7 9.

Something to note is White’s awkwardly-placed knight on a3. White would like to transfer this knight to a better square, say after Nc2-d4; but this is not always easy due to the pressure on the c4-pawn. } 15... Bf8 { The premature  15...d5 ?  would be met by:  16.Bf4 !  Bd6  17.cxd5  exd5  18.Nc4 !  Quite an unpleasant surprise!  18...Nxc4  19.Bxc4  dxc4  20.Bxd6  Rc8  21.Qd4  ± } 16.

As mentioned previously, White should try to meet the ...g7-g5 plan with a well-timed c4-c5 break. } 23... Rgc8 { A curious approach; Black was ready to play ...g7-g5, but now simply decides to go for a different plan. It is typically a mistake to waste three moves on a plan and later choose to do something else. But sometimes in the hedgehog Black can afford such a decision due to the amazing flexibility of the structure.   White was well prepared to meet  23...g5  with:  24.Nd2  Rg6   or  24...g4  25.f4  ±  25.Na4  Ned7  26.c5 !

As it turns out, when White’s knight can reach  c3  so easily and White’s bishop is on  f1  , the  ...b6-b5  break is unlikely to work well. White is nearly winning after  30...Nc4  31.Nxc4  bxc4  32.b5  R6c7  33.a4  due to the connected passed pawns. } 29. a4 Qb8 { It is amazing how Black continues to wait without causing any deterioration in his position. It seems Black has not done anything, however he has carefully analyzed White’s threats, and is ready to meet them. } 30. b5 { This is not the right timing for this break, as the b6- and d6-pawns do not become targets as they did in the game Flores Rios – Hayrapetian earlier in this chapter.   Better was  30.Nc3 !?  and a possible continuation would be  30...R6c7  31.Qf2  Rd8  32.Be2  with roughly equal chances. } 30... R6c7 { Worse is  30...axb5 ?!  31.axb5  since now White has a potential threat Nc3-a4 attacking the b6-pawn. In addition, the potentially weak a4-pawn has been traded. The play could continue  31...R6c7  32.Nc3  Ra7  33.Nca4  Qc7  34.Qf2  Rb8  35.Ra1  with a level game. } 31. bxa6 { In the event of  31.Nc3  a5 !  White does not have any breaks on the queenside and Black may turn his attention back to the kingside by playing  ...Rg8  followed by  ...g7-g5.  For example:  32.Bg5 !?  Preventing Black’s plan momentarily.  32...Bf8  33.Be2  h6  34.Bh4  g5  35.Bg3  Nc5  =+ White’s position is unpleasant in practice, as he does not have a clear-cut plan. } 31... Nc5 32. Qc2 Ra7 33. Nc3 Rxa6 { Black’s strategy has been successful and his position is now preferable due to his strong knights on c5 and e5.  The rest of the game is irrelevant to our purposes, though eventually Black won.  Final remarks  1. This game was a test of nerves for both players. Each player attempted to carry out their plans, but found a well-prepared opponent. If Black had played 15...d5 or 23...g5, he would have reached an inferior position. In turn, White lost his patience and broke with 30.b5, which gave him a worse position.  2. This type of position requires great precision in calculation from both sides, since they must constantly check how to prevent or meet their opponent’s breaks. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Maroczy@@HeaderEnd@@  The Maroczy structure we study in this chapter bears a great similarity with the Hedgehog from the previous chapter. In fact, some sources may call that chapter's structure Maroczy as well, simply because White has placed his pawns on c4 and e4. In this book, I decided to give a separate treatment to these two structures because I consider they are sufficiently different. The difference is in how Black develops his dark-squared bishop. In the Hedgehog chapter, Black's bishop was always developed on e7, hence ...e7-e6 had been played. Here instead we study those positions where Black fianchettoes his bishop on g7. Most importantly, Black's e-pawn often remains on e7. This fact has the following consequences:  1. White can place a knight on d5, which can lead to a major structural transformation if Black trades the knight.  2. The central break ...d6-d5 is no longer a main theme here.  3. Black can trade pieces without worrying about the d6-pawn becoming vulnerable, as happened in the game Eljanov - Jakovenko from the previous chapter.  The structure we study in this chapter is typical of the Accelerated Dragon, but it can also arise as a transposition from the English Opening or some lines that start out as a King's Indian. It can also occur with reversed colours if White plays the English Opening, allowing Black to reply ...d5 and later ...c5. Most examples in this chapter will come from the Accelerated Dragon because it is the most common source of Maroczy games. Nevertheless, the ideas transfer easily to the other lines. The main theme of the Maroczy is White's spatial advantage, which means Black will often attempt to trade pieces and later fight on in the endgame phase.  White's plans  1. Gain space with a queenside expansion, place a knight on d5, and/or expand on the kingside with f2-f4.  2. After f2-f4 has been played, place rooks on the central files and break with either e4-e5 or f4-f5.  3. Place a knight on d5 and wait for Black to capture on d5. Once this happens, White can transform the structure favourably with either exd5 or cxd5. Each of these replies is studied at the beginning of this chapter.  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to alleviate the space problem.  2. Break on the queenside with ...b6-b5 and after c4xb5 and ...a6xb5 then apply pressure along the a-file.  3. Break on the kingside with ...f7-f5 and later create an attack against White's king.  4. Pressure White's queenside pawns with ...Qb6-b4, and when White plays b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3.  5. On rare occasions play ...e7-e6 and later ...d6-d5, though this plan is more typical of the Hedgehog.  Out of the plans mentioned above, it should be said that White's first three plans are more or less equally common, while Black's first three plans are the most common for him. Black's fifth plan is almost never carried out in games which originate from the Accelerated Dragon variation. } 1. -- *

{ Symmetric Transformation  When White places a knight on d5 and Black captures it, White's recapture changes the character of the game dramatically. The first four examples of this chapter discuss White's cxd5 recapture. The next two are examples of the recapture exd5. Then we have two examples of Black's ...f7-f5 break, one example of the ...b7-b5 break, and the chapter concludes with one example exploring White's f4-f5 and e4-e5 breaks.  This structure most typically occurs when we have a Maroczy structure and White places a knight on d5. Once Black captures this knight then White recaptures cxd5. We will call this the symmetric transformation of the Maroczy. The main theme in this structure is White's spatial advantage. As the reader will notice, there are no natural breaks in this position. Black could attempt to challenge White's centre with ...e7-e6 or ...f7-f5, but these breaks mostly weaken Black's camp and can eventually backfire. For this reason, it is easy for Black to run out of useful moves and fall into an inferior position where White expands to ultimately obtain a winning position. Now, let's discuss specific plans for each side.  White's plans  1. Control the c-file and use it for a seventh rank invasion if this is possible.  2. Avoid excessive exchanges in order to make use of the spatial advantage.  3. Further expand on the queenside and kingside, squeeze Black's forces and then find a decisive break.  Black's plans  1. Trade pieces to decrease the space problem.  2. Take possession of the open c-file, and if possible invade the seventh rank with ...Rc2.  3. If White has played b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3 can be useful to open another file for counterplay.  4. If the position is already simplified, and White threatens to gain space with flank expansions, then challenge White's centre with ...e7-e6 to create a distraction. This plan can backfire due to the weaknesses created, but they should not be too serious if the queens are already off the board.  As the reader will notice, White's plans of action are far more dangerous than Black's, and this is all a consequence of White's spatial advantage. Black must be careful and understand this structure can lead to a passive position. The first three examples are illustrations of White's first three plans all combined together to yield very convincing wins. In each of these three examples I will put forward suggestions to avoid losing passively in the way Black lost. Then, the fourth example is a fragment of a game to illustrate one of Black's thematic tricks to find counterplay. } 1. -- *

Final remarks  1. Black’s opening was rather imprecise, leading directly to an unfavourable endgame. Nowadays 12...Qxa2 is the move of choice and in fact White no longer plays 12.Nd5 because of this reply.  2. The endgame resulting after move 14 was indisputably superior for White, and the defence was very difficult in practice.  3. Black’s best approach would have been to break the powerful d5-e4 chain with a timely ...e7-e6 break. This weakens the d6- and e6-pawns, but it is the lesser of two evils. Instead, by defending passively Black was signing his own death sentence. White’s kingside expansion is a winning plan and passive defence is destined to fail no matter how precise.  4. White’s expansion on the flanks was enabled by his pair of bishops and his already existing spatial edge in the centre. By having more space, White is able to gain yet more. } *

Black’s problems began by forgetting his opening move order, and allowing the strong 13.Nd5, which is an improved version of the previous game, as the ...Qxa2 reply is no longer available.  2. Despite his opening imprecision, Black had reasonable chances to hold the game by trading rooks on move 19.   3. Black’s biggest mistake was attempting to block the c-file with 19...Nc5, as White will gain this file anyway after the standard b3-b4. Black’s problem was that supporting his knight on c5 meant creating more weaknesses with 20...a5 and 21...b6, hence later when the c-file was finally unblocked, White gained a huge advantage. } *

{ Jakovljevic – Predojevic, Novi Sad 2012, started out as a Maroczy and reached the position in the diagram, which is similar to previous examples.

Nevertheless, almost every line required precision from Black, while White could play for a win risk-free.  4. Something to mention from the initial position is Black’s pawn on a4, which is the same colour as his bishop.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Asymmetric Transformation@@HeaderEnd@@  Once the knight on d5 is captured, White can also recapture cxd5 to obtain a very different kind of position, which we call the asymmetric transformation of the Maroczy. Unlike the symmetric transformation, the recapture cxd5 is much more tactical and double-edged. White typically attempts a mating attack while Black will gain counterplay on the queenside. Black has a backward pawn on e7 which could become a target for White's rooks. However, Black can often neutralize this pressure by simply placing his dark-squared bishop on f6.  White's plans  1. Create a kingside attack with the break f2-f4-f5 .  2. Pressure the e7-pawn by doubling rooks on the e-file. This is only likely to work if Black cannot place a bishop on f6.  Black's plans  1. Attack White's c4-d5 chain with the break ...b7-b5xc4.  2. Open the a-file with ...a7-a5-a4xb3. If White responds to ...a5-a4 with b3-b4, then the c4-d5 chain becomes weaker, and the break ...b7-b5 could be stronger.  3. Simplify the position to minimize White's attacking chances.  White's kingside attack is very effective if Black cannot create the appropriate distraction with queenside play. For this reason, it is a must for Black to have at least one queenside break at hand. In contrast, if Black realizes he will not be able to find a queenside break, then he should probably avoid this structure altogether, or find a way to swap queens before an attack develops.  If Black desires to press for a win, the best approach is to combine Plans 1-3  (or 2-3)  , when trading queens is most important. Once Black has played ...b7-b5xc4, and White recaptures b3xc4, then the c4-pawn becomes a serious longterm target. This weakness is often more serious than Black's e7-pawn which is easily defended by a bishop on f6 or a king on f8.  The next example will show us the power of White's kingside attack once Black has missed the opportunity to achieve a queenside break. Then, we will see a short fragment to illustrate the ease of Black's play in an endgame, once the c4-pawn has been weakened. } 1. -- *

Rg3 Qc6 29. f6 { An alternative was  29.Bd4  d5  30.Qf4  threatening f5-f6:  30...Qf6  31.Kh1   but not  31.fxg6 ?  Nf3+ !  31...dxc4  32.fxg6  Qxf4  33.gxh7+  Kh8  34.Rxf4  ± } 29... Bh8 30.

Bxg6 { +-   Black resigns, as the following lines offer no escape:  31...hxg6   or  31...fxg6  32.f7+  Kf8  33.Qxh8+  Ke7  34.fxe8  =Q#  32.Rxg6+ !  And checkmate is unavoidable. For example:  32...Kh7   32...fxg6  33.f7+  33.Qh4+  Kxg6  34.Qh6#  Final remarks  1. The reader should note how in this game the capture 20.cxd5 would not have given much to White. It is necessary to know the pros and cons of both structures in order to choose correctly.  2. Once White stabilized the queenside with a3-a4, he had a free hand for a kingside attack. It is unlikely that Black could resist successfully. } *

{ The position in the diagram occurred in the game Aziz – Vazquez Igarza, Madrid 2011. White’s opening phase was rather imprecise, and at this point Black is ready to play: } 1... Bxd5 2. exd5 { Worse is:  16.cxd5 ?!  Rc1+  17.Kf2  Rac8  =+ } 2... Nd7 { Black finds a good opportunity to trade off White’s pair of bishops. For the rest of the game White will be weak on the dark squares. } 3. Bxg7 { Unfortunately  17.Be3 ?  loses an exchange to  17...Bc3. } 3... Kxg7 4. Be2 { Slightly preferable was:  18.Kf2  But now Black finds counterplay with:  18...a5 !   While  18...b5 ?  19.cxb5  ± no longer works for Black.  19.Bd3   Or  19.a4  Nc5  20.Rb2  Ra6 !  followed by  ...Rb6  19...a4  20.b4   20.Re1  axb3  21.axb3  Kf8  22.Bb1  Ra3  =+  20...Rc7  21.Re1  Kf8  22.f4  Rac8  Note how the c4-pawn is weaker than Black’s e7-pawn.  23.Rc2  b5 !  24.Rec1  bxc4  25.Bxc4  Nb6  26.Bd3  Rxc2+  27.Rxc2  Rxc2+  28.Bxc2  Nxd5  29.b5  Nb6  =+ Here only Black can play for a win. } 4... b5 { Black achieves the thematic break for this structure. } 5. Kf2 { The capture  19.cxb5 ?  is met by  19...Rc1+  20.Rd1   or  20.Bd1  axb5  ∓  20...Rxd1+  21.Kxd1  axb5  22.Bxb5  Rxa2 !  ∓ when White has weaknesses everywhere, and of course  23.Bxd7 ?  loses to  23...Ra1+  24.Kc2  Rxh1. } 5... bxc4 6. bxc4 { Now the c4-pawn will be a permanent weakness.   It was necessary to play  20.Bxc4  Nb6  21.Be2  Rc5  22.Rhd1  a5  =+ though Black is in control. } 6... Rab8 { Black controls the b-file and has a clear target in the c4-pawn; White has no counterplay whatsoever. } 7. Rc1 Rb4 8. Rdc2 Rcb8 9. Ke3 Nc5 { Black has complete control of the dark squares and White’s light-squared bishop is actually quite useless. Black can progress slowly but surely. } 10. Rc3 Kf6 11. R3c2 Ra4 12. Rd1 Ra3+ 13. Kd2 h5 { Expansion on the kingside! } 14. h4 Ke5 15. Ke1 Na4 16. Kf2 { 30.Rdd2  does not help:  Rb1+  31.Kf2  Ra1  32.g3  a5  33.Kg2  Kf6  34.Kf2  Nc5  35.Kg2  Na6  36.Kf2  Nb4  Black wins as the a2-pawn is lost after all. } 16... Rb2 17. Rxb2 Nxb2 18. Rd2 Rxa2 { Black has a clear extra pawn and won convincingly.  Final remarks  1. The reader should understand that this version of the asymmetric transformation was very bad for White from the start. The queens were off the board, White was forced to trade his dark-squared bishop, and most importantly, he could not prevent Black from breaking on the queenside.  2. Once Black captured ...bxc4, White’s recapture bxc4 was like accepting the loss, as Black obtained a dominant position and White found himself without a plan. At that point there was basically nothing to do other than wait. } *
