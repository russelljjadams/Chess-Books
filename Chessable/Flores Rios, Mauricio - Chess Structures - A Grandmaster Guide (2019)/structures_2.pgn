Be2 Qe7 4. dxc5 bxc5 { The alternative   18...Nxc5  19.Bxg7  Qxg7  is okay too, but it gives more mobility to White's Queenside majority. } 5. Bxg7 Qxg7 { We have reached a critical moment in the game. Black's plan in quite clear: he must advance his pawn majority on the kingside and possibly create some threats against the king. White must create counterplay by pushing his majority on the queenside, but this is not easy as after b3-b4 the c4-pawn will be vulnerable. Black's position is not necessarily superior from an objective perspective, but the reader should understand that conducting Black's side will be a much simpler task than White's. } *

For this reason, the most memorable point in this game was Zvjaginsev's idea 15.Nf5 followed by 16.Ne3 and later recapturing with Nxc4. This turned the c6-pawn into a permanent weakness while preventing Black's further breaks with ...c6-c5 or ...a6-a5. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Slav Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Slav formation could very well also be called the Queen's Gambit Accepted formation, as it originates from Black capturing ...dxc4 in a Queen's Gambit position. This structure shares many common features with the Caro-Kann structure we studied in the previous chapter. To start, Black's pawn trade ...dxc4 still results in:  1. White gaining better control of the centre.  2. White having more space by virtue of a pawn on the fourth rank. Similarly to the previous chapter, White has a comfortable advantage in this structure, and Black should hope to break free with a central break.  Specific plans can be formulated as follows:  White's plans  The control of the centre opens up multiple opportunities for White everywhere on the board. Similarly to the previous chapter, White has the plans:  1. Creating a kingside attack, this time with h2-h4-h5-h6  (or hxg6 if applicable)  and possibly e3-e4-e5.  2. Placing knights on the strong outposts e5 and c5, controlling the centre.  3. Playing e4-e5 to fix the centre and control the d6-square  (similar to c4-c5 in the previous chapter)  .  Unlike the previous chapter, White also has the possibility of:  4. Carrying out a minority attack with a2-a4 and b2-b4-b5, in order to create a weakness on the queenside.  5. Simply gaining space with b2-b4, as well as preventing the ...c6-c5 break. This is far more likely than playing f2-f4 in the Caro-Kann structure, simply because f2-f4 weakens White's king somewhat.  Black's plans  The main objective is to dispute White's centre and transform the structure. This can be achieved by:  1. Breaking in the centre with ...c6-c5, probably obtaining a symmetrical position after dxc5, or an isolani after ...c5xd4.  2. Breaking in the centre with ...e6-e5 will probably produce a 4-2 versus 3-3 pawn structure with roughly level chances.  3. Exerting pressure on the d4-pawn once e3-e4 has been played.  4. Disrupting White's centre with ...f7-f5. This is analogous to the plan ...b7-b5 in the Caro-Kann structure.  Similarly to the previous chapter, White's plans aim for an advantage, while most of Black's plans aim to equalize by transforming the structure. Black's Plan 3 rarely works, either because the d4-pawn can be easily defended, or because White players know when to refrain from e3-e4, exactly in order to prevent this plan. It should be noted that Black's Plan 2 is more likely to be achieved since White can often prevent Plan 1 by placing a rook on the open c-file.  Outposts  Black may place a knight on his d5-outpost, but this knight cannot compete with White's knights placed on the e5- and c5-squares. White can easily push e3-e4 to get rid of the knight on d5 if it is absolutely necessary. In contrast, White's knights on c5 or e5 are harder to deal with, as they are on the fifth rank, and Black cannot easily expel them. Chasing them away with ...f7-f6 and ...b7-b6 would create serious weaknesses on e6 and c6 respectively.   The first example in this chapter illustrates White's attacking chances on the kingside, while the second game is an example of White's positional advantage in an endgame in which Black loses by asphyxiation. The third and fourth games are devoted to the central breaks ...c6-c5 and ...e6-e5 respectively. The last game in the chapter is a combination of Black's Plans 3 and 4. The chapter finishes with a short fragment to exemplify White's Plan 3. } 1. -- *

This flank attack should have been met with the conceptually correct central break 22...c5 !.  3. In retrospect, it might have been objectively better to play 20.Bf4 securing a small positional edge, though practical chances should not be ignored. It is true that Black had one way to maintain equality against White’s attack; but how strong does a player need to be in order to find such a precise continuation? The strong GM Zhao was unable to defend, so I believe White’s attack is possibly the strongest continuation, at least on a practical level. } *

White should constantly calculate liberation attempts, such as  21...b6 ?!  22.Nb3  c5 ?!  but fortunately for White, in this case, this attempt is refuted by  23.dxc5  bxc5  24.Nca5 !  ± winning material. } 22.

Re1 { Speculating on a potential e3-e4. Note how Black constantly needs to calculate how to defend against potential threats, while White can choose his moves almost randomly. A practical strategy for White is to continuously present Black with potential threats, but without carrying out any of them until the right time has come. Often White will continue to use this strategy until Black commits a serious mistake, or finds himself in time trouble, and only then will White embark on decisive action. } 29... N5f6 { Preventing e3-e4.   To illustrate how delicate Black’s position is, note how the natural  29...Rf8  falls into trouble after  30.Rb2 !  (threatening Nc5 winning a pawn)  30...Rfc8  31.e4 !  fxe4  32.Rxe4  ± and Black is on the verge of losing. } 30. Rb1 { Threatening Nc5 winning a pawn. } 30... Rec8 31. Rbc1 Rd8 { More stubborn was  31...Nb6. } 32. a4 { ± Preparing a break with b4-b5 in order to invade Black’s camp via the c-file. } 32... Ne4 { Mamedyarov miscalculates in an already very difficult situation.   The correct defence was  32...Ne8 !  33.b5  cxb5  34.axb5  Nd6  35.Rc7  Nxb5  36.Rxb7  Rxb7  37.Nxb7  Rb8  38.Na5  ± though Black’s position is full of weaknesses. } 33. b5 cxb5 34. Rc7 { This would have been prevented if Black’s knight had been on e8. } 34... Nd6 { 34...bxa4 ?  loses to  35.Nxb7  Re8  36.Ne5  Nef6  37.Nc6+. } 35. Nc5 bxa4 { A better defence was  35...Ne8  36.Rxb7  Rxb7  37.Ncxb7  Ra8  38.axb5  though Black’s position is practically lost. } 36. Ncxb7 Nxb7 37. Nxb7 Rf8 38. R1c6 { +- Black’s position falls apart due to the threat of 39.Nc5. } 38... Rf7 39. Nc5 Ke8 40. Rxe6+ Kd8 41. Rec6 { Black resigns as the a7- and a4-pawns will soon be lost.  Final remarks  1. If Black wishes to equalize, it is absolutely necessary to find a break by either ...e6-e5 or ...c6-c5.   2. The endgame starting on move 19 was nearly lost on a practical level. The reason is that Black could not create any counterplay or find any way to equalize. Meanwhile, White could move his pieces around the entire board, speculating with multiple threats. Even Super-GMs like Mamedyarov cannot avoid decisive mistakes under such circumstances. } *

Qd2 { We have reached the position of interest, and the reader should pay close attention to the differences between this game and the previous one. In the current game, two minor pieces are off the board already, decreasing Black’s space problem. In addition, the moves a2-a4 and ...a7-a5 greatly favour Black, as they give a strong square for the knight on b4 and have eliminated White’s chances to expand on the queenside in the future with the usual b2-b4. Finally, Black has a concrete plan, which is ...b7-b6, ...Ba6  (or ...Bb7)  followed by placing the rooks in the centre and pushing ...c6-c5. Unlike the previous game, White lacks pieces to prevent such liberation. For all the above reasons, the reader should understand that Black has chosen correctly when he decided to play this pawn structure. } 14... O-O 15. O-O Rd8 16. Rfd1 b6 17.

The main message of this game is that White cannot really hope for an advantage if he is unable to prevent a ...c6-c5 break.  2. A crucial role was played by the weakening move a2-a4 and Black’s knight on b4, which substantially limited the coordination of White’s pieces. For example, on moves 17-19 White would have liked to play Rac1, but could not due to ...Na2 winning an exchange. } *

The break ...f7-f5 is an important move in Black’s strategy, undermining the control of the d5-square.  4. The idea of ...f7-f5, followed by trading pawns on e4 and playing ...e7-e5, is thematic and strategically sound, as it turns the e4-pawn into a permanent weakness. } *

{ I decided to finish this chapter with a short fragment from the game Andreikin – Kramnik, Dortmund 2013.  White continued with: } 1. e5 { Fixing the centre and preventing Black from eventually releasing his position with ...e6-e5. It should be noted that the advance e4-e5 has some crucial differences compared with the advance c4-c5 we studied in the previous chapter. Most importantly:  1. White gains direct chances for an attack since the e5-pawn controls the important f6-square.  2. Black is far more likely to achieve ...c6-c5 in this position than he was to achieve ...e6-e5 in the previous chapter.  3. In the previous chapter Black’s light-squared bishop was completely restricted. Since ...c6-c5 is not exactly impossible, Black’s bishop can find some activity from the b7-square.  4. There exists a possibility to break White’s centre with ...f7-f6 since White cannot easily play f2-f4. In contrast, in the previous chapter White could almost always respond with b2-b4 against Black’s ...b7-b6.   Similarly to the previous chapter, the d4-pawn is not really vulnerable, and Black is rather unlikely to gain anything from placing a knight on the d5-square.   If White plays  11.Bd3  Nd7  12.O-O ?   it was not too late for  12.e5 !  12...e5 !  Black equalizes completely. } 1... O-O 2. Bd3 b6 { Black typically would attempt the break with  12...f6 ?  but here it is impossible since the g6-pawn falls after  13.Bxg6. } 3. O-O Rd8 { If  13...Ba6  14.Qb3  Bxd3  15.Qxd3  Rd8  16.Qe4  ± White is in control, as Black cannot develop his knight. } 4. Qb3 Bb7 5. Be4 Rd7 6. Rfd1 { This is a position to remember: White is in complete control of the game and the weakness of the backward d4-pawn is only symbolic. Black continued with 16...c5 accepting a permanently weak c-pawn, which led him to lose. The rest of the game is irrelevant to our study, but the reader should carefully examine the differences between the e4-e5 and c4-c5 advances, contrasting this chapter and the previous one. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@The Carlsbad Formation@@HeaderEnd@@  The Carlsbad, also known as the Orthodox Exchange formation, is a very well-known and thoroughly studied pawn structure. In fact, it is one of the few pawn structures which has received the attention other structures in this book deserve. The Carlsbad can be reached from many different move orders, and in some cases with reversed colours, such as in the Caro-Kann after: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5. Despite this fact, every game presented in this chapter will have White and Black playing the roles as presented in the diagram at the left.  White's plans  This position offers two main lines of attack for White:  1. Pursuing the so-called minority attack with b2-b4-b5 in order to create a queenside weakness.  2. Pushing f2-f3 and e3-e4  (or sometimes e3-e4 directly)  gaining central space and creating tension.  Given any position, it is likely that only one of these plans will work well. This will depend on how the pieces are arranged, and how Black's queenside structure is set up. For example, the character of the game can change dramatically if Black's pawns are set up as a7-b6-c7 instead of the more typical a6-b7-c6. In addition, White's queenside plan is less likely to work if the light-squared bishop has been developed on g2.  Black's plans  1. The main plan is to place a knight on e4 and to create a kingside attack, but this is not always possible. For example, White might choose a set-up in which f2-f3 is included   2. The most common auxiliary plan is to play ...b7-b6 and ...c6-c5 in order to transpose into a hanging pawns position. Or sometimes just ...c6-c5 is played directly, hence dxc5 transposes into an isolani.  3. An important though far less common plan is to play ...b7-b5 once White has played b2-b4, in order to obtain a firm outpost for a knight placed on c4. This plan is less common because ...b7-b5 also creates a weakness - a backward c6-pawn, which could cause this plan to backfire.  The first game in this chapter illustrates how necessary it is for White to place his dark-squared bishop outside the pawn chain  (say on g5 instead of d2)  . The second game is an ideal execution of White's minority attack, while the third is an example of Black neutralizing this plan after some precise moves. The fourth game in the chapter explains how White must react if Black's queenside is arranged as a7-b6-c7. The last two games show the consequences of White carrying out the e3-e4 break first successfully and then unsuccessfully. } 1. -- *

Black’s move ...Rac8 was somewhat unexpected, but very important, as the break ...c6-c5 played a crucial role in many variations.  I hope this game leaves a strong impression on the reader. White’s dark-squared bishop must be outside the pawn chain for White to have a chance in the Carlsbad structure.    Making a Caro-Kann analogy to this example, after the sequence  1.e4  c6  2.d4  d5  3.exd5  cxd5  4.Bd3  Nc6  5.c3  it would be absolutely incorrect to play  5...e6 ?  as it locks the bishop inside the pawn chain, allowing White to gain a powerful attack as Black did in the previous game. } *

Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 b6 5. e3 Bb7 6. Bd3 O-O 7. O-O d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. a3 Bd6 10. b4 { Everything is being played according to modern theory; in fact there are over 250 games with this position. One should pay close attention to Black’s pawn structure on the queenside. The most typical Carlsbad structure has pawns on a6-b7-c6-d5, which makes the b4-b5 break quite powerful. In this case, it might seem that White has little to hope for since b4-b5 does not create any weak pawns, but this is not quite the case. White’s plan is to first gain some space on the queenside with b4-b5 and a3-a4, weakening the c6-square and  'isolating” the d5-pawn, and then either play Ba3xd6 in order to weaken the c7-pawn, or blow up the centre with e3-e4. In both cases, Black’s counterplay is associated with placing a knight on e4 and then creating a kingside attack, possibly through ...f7-f5 and ...g6-g5, as illustrated in the note to Black’s 10th move. } 10... a6 { An alternative was:  10...a5  11.b5  Nbd7  12.Bd2 ?!   instead I would have recommended  12.Qb3  followed by a3-a4 and  Ba3  trading Black’s dark-squared bishop to weaken the c7-pawn  12...Ne4  A good decision; it is crucial for Black to gain control of the e4-square, not only to prevent an eventual e3-e4 break, but also to gain attacking prospects on the kingside.  13.a4  Qe7  14.h3  f5  Reinforcing the knight on  e4  and increasing the attacking chances against White’s monarch.  15.Qc2  Ndf6  16.Rac1  Rae8  17.Ne2  g5  Black obtained a dangerous attack in Malaniuk – Annageldyev, Alushta 2007. } 11. Qb3 Qe7 12. Rb1 Nbd7 13. a4 Rfb8 { The rook is rather useless on this square.   Preferable was:  13...Rfe8  14.b5  axb5   worse is  14...a5  15.Ra1  Rad8  16.Ba3  as trading dark-squared bishops weakens the c7-pawn:  16...h6  17.Bxd6  cxd6   or  17...Qxd6  18.Rac1  +=  18.Rac1  += when White has a pleasant position, as in Ionov – Shaposhnikov, St Petersburg 2003  15.axb5  Ne4 !  When White must probably accept the challenge and sacrifice an exchange with:  16.Nxd5  Bxd5  17.Qxd5  Nc3  18.Qb3  Nxb1  19.Qxb1   or  19.Bxb1  Nf6  20.e4  Nxe4  21.Re1  Qe6  22.Qxe6  Rxe6  23.Bxe4  Ra1  ∞ when Black will regain the two bishops for a rook  19...Nf6  Controlling the e4-square, with an approximately level game. } 14. b5 axb5 15. axb5 g6 { The typical  15...Ne4 ?!  does not work well due to  16.Nxd5  Bxd5  17.Qxd5  Nc3  18.Qc4  Nxb1  19.Bxb1  += with very good compensation for the exchange, as Black cannot prevent the advance e3-e4 with:  19...Nf6 ?!  20.e4 !  Nxe4 ?  21.Re1  +- This variation illustrates why Black’s rook on  e8  was important. } 16. h3 h6 { Again, the desired  16...Ne4  is met by  17.Nxd5  Bxd5  18.Qxd5  Nc3  19.Qc6  Nxb1  20.Bxb1  += followed by e3-e4. } 17. Re1 { Beginning to prepare the break e3-e4. } 17... Ra7 { Once again:  17...Ne4  18.Nxd5 !  += } 18. Bb2 { An interesting alternative was  18.Bxg6 !?  fxg6  19.e4  with a dangerous initiative, for example  19...Nh5  20.e5  Ba3  21.Bxh6  Nf8   21...Qe6 ?  22.Ng5 !  +- followed by  Nxd5  22.g4  Ng7  23.Nxd5  with an attack. } 18... Qe6 { Protecting d5, hoping for the desired 19...Ne4. } 19. Nd2 { Reinforcing the control of e4, White is almost ready to break in the centre. } 19... Rba8 { Note how ineffective Black’s play is on the queenside, as after so many moves there is still no semblance of a threat.   Unfortunately for Black  19...Ne4 ?  simply loses a pawn after  20.Ncxe4  dxe4  21.Qxe6  fxe6  22.Nxe4. } 20. Qc2 Bf8 21. e4 { ± The desired break at the right time. White gains a very powerful initiative in the centre, and Black is unable to deal with it. } 21... dxe4 { It was preferable to simply give up a pawn with  21...Qe7  22.exd5   or  22.e5 !?  ±  22...Qd8  23.Bc4  ± though Black still needs to be careful with tactical shots, such as d5-d6 threatening  Qxg6. } 22. Ndxe4 Bxe4 { 22...Nxe4  is no improvement:  23.d5 !  Qe7   or  23...Bxd5  24.Nxd5  Qxd5  25.Bxe4  Qxb5  when White does not bother with  Bxa8  , but instead  26.Bxg6 !  +-  24.Nxe4  (threatening Nf6)  24...Qd8  25.Qc3  f6  26.Bc2  followed by  Qg3  with a decisive attack. } 23. Nxe4 Bg7 { The alternative  23...Nxe4  is a nice illustration of White’s positional dominance; after  24.Bxe4  Re8  25.Re3 !  White’s advantage does not rely on a specific tactical shot, but rather on his great piece coordination, and Black’s inability to protect the back rank, as illustrated by the variation:  25...Qd6  26.Rbe1  Bg7  27.Qc4  Rf8  28.Bc2  Nf6   28...Raa8  29.Re6 !  +-  29.Bb3  Raa8  30.Re7  +- } 24. Bc4 Qf5 25. g4 { An unlikely yet highly effective resource, taking advantage of the awkward location of Black’s queen.   The more standard  25.Re3 !?  should also be winning. } 25... Qf3 { Instead  25...Qf4 ?  loses to  26.Bc1  Qf3  27.Rb3  and the queen is trapped.   There is nothing to hope for after  25...Nxg4  26.hxg4  Qxg4+  27.Ng3. } 26. Re3 Qf4 27. Ng3 { Threatening Qxg6. } 27... Nf8 28. Bxf7+ { A nice blow! The attack is overwhelming and White finished off the game with ease. } 28... Kh7 { The bishop is immune, because of  28...Kxf7 ?  29.Qb3+  Ne6  30.Rxe6  Kf8  31.Rbe1  followed by  Re7  , and White wins. } 29. Bb3 Rd8 30. Rbe1 Rd7 31. Re5 Ra8 32. Qc4 Rad8 33. R1e4 Qd2 { Not  33...Nxe4 ??  34.Qg8#. } 34. Bc3 Qc1+ 35. Kg2 Nd5 36. Ne2 Qa3 37. Nf4 Bxe5 38. Nxd5 Rxd5 39. Rxe5 c6 { Again, not  39...Rxe5 ??  40.Qg8#. } 40. Bb4 Qa8 41. bxc6 b5 42. Qxd5 Rxd5 43. Bxd5 { Black resigns. The final position is quite picturesque. The strong c6-pawn, together with White’s bishops, makes the position impossible to defend, for example:  43...Qd8  44.c7  Qxc7  45.Re7+  Final remarks  1. Whenever Black arranges his pawns as in the game, with a7-b6-c7, White must carefully analyze whether he will be able to dispute Black’s control of the e4-square. If that is not the case, something is likely to go wrong.  2. If White can dispute the e4-square, then the plan b4-b5 followed by an eventual e3-e4 is very powerful, as it opens many lines for attack. Positionally, it also makes sense, as Black’s backward c7-pawn and the c6-square may become vulnerable after e3-e4, especially if light-squared bishops are traded on e4.   3. Finally, Black had nothing to hope for down the a-file or on the queenside for that matter. Hence Black’s 13th move proved to be an utter waste of time. } *

Black’s capture 20...dxe4 is illogical, as it clears the way for the bishop on g2. After this mistake Black’s position became extremely fragile, causing an early collapse. } *

This is not the case: the dark-squared bishop can be inside the pawn chain as long as White is planning the break e3-e4 which would render this bishop useful again.  3. White’s opening did not achieve more than equality. White lost the game because after e3-e4 was played, his inaccuracies forced him into an inferior endgame. A crucial mistake was the slow 19.Kh2 steering White into passive defence. } *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Stonewall@@HeaderEnd@@  The Stonewall structure often arises from the Dutch Defence, the Slav or the Catalan, the first being the most common. It could also occur with reversed colours, but this is relatively rare. Of all the pawn structures we study in this book, the Stonewall has one of the worst reputations. Players from a wide range of levels would say the idea of playing ...d7-d5 together with ...f7-f5 is positionally unsound. There is partial merit to this claim, as the e5-square becomes permanently vulnerable. Whether this vulnerable square actually becomes a serious weakness often determines whether Black's position is good or not. To be honest, I myself considered the Stonewall to be a relatively bad structure until I started researching it in order to write this chapter. In fact, I originally wanted to make this chapter a manual on how to defeat this pawn structure. After a substantial amount of work, I gave up on this aim, and instead decided to accept that the Stonewall is a solid system which deserves serious consideration. I hope this chapter will be enough to convince the reader that this is the case.  Then why does the Stonewall have a bad reputation?  I believe this is the effect of two types of observational bias:  1. White's wins in the Stonewall are often visually pleasing and positionally convincing. They are likely to be used as examples in strategy books. This decision unintentionally conveys the idea that the Stonewall is positionally incorrect.  2. Black's wins are often based on tactical resources of some sort, hence they can often be considered 'accidental' rather than meritorious. Many players  (including myself before writing this chapter)  would skip chose games without further study, simply thinking: 'Black was just lucky, this will not happen to me.'  Personally, I was surprised on checking my database to realize that among IM and GM level games, White only scores about 54% with the openings presented in this chapter. This is basically a standard result, nothing special. Hence, statistically, the Stonewall is slightly inferior but no worse than many well-respected systems.  OK, that is enough defending the Stonewall, now let's discuss typical plans.  White's plans  1. Obtaining firm control of the e5-square; placing a knight on this square.  2. Trade dark-squared bishops to further weaken Black's dark squares.  3. Expand on the queenside or open the c-file at a favourable stage and pursue an invasion down this open file.  Black's plans  1. Create a kingside attack, but without completely losing control of the central squares.  2. Improve the bad bishop with the manoeuvre ...Bd7-e8-h5 or sometimes ...b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6.  3. Create central tension with ...b7-b6 followed by ...c6-c5.  Before proceeding, I would like to clarify Black's plans somewhat. First, for Black's Plan 1 to succeed, the control of the central squares is essential. If White has undisputed control of the e5-square, then most of Black's attacking attempts will fail. A healthy attack for Black will keep a balance between fighting for the e5-square and advancing on the kingside. Black's Plan 2 is important and useful, but not always necessary. Black can find a good position even with his bishop on the humble d7-square. Finally, Black's Plans 1 and 3 should certainly not be combined. The point of Plan 1 is that the Stonewall creates a solid central structure, making a flank attack feasible. The attack would probably fail if the move ...c6-c5 had already been played.  This chapter begins by showing one short example of White's dream position in the Stonewall, simply to illustrate everything Black should fight to avoid. The second and third games are examples of White's successful strategy, controlling the centre and keeping Black without counterplay. The last three games in the chapter illustrate Black's ideas for counterplay by showcasing Black's Plans 1, 2 and 3 in that order. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Sandro Mareco – Chithambaram Aravindh, Golden Sands 2013@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:  This game fragment essentially illustrates everything that could go wrong with Black’s position, and how White may win convincingly under those circumstances.  As the reader may notice, White is doing extremely well in this game. To be thorough and comprehensive, let’s outline exactly what is good about White’s position:  1. The key e5-square is under complete control.  2. It would require about four moves for Black to remove White’s knight on e5, say with ...Rf6-f8, ...Ne8-f6-d7.   3. Black’s bishop is completely locked in by his pawns; there is no route into the game.  4. Black’s kingside pawns are not flexible. If the g4-pawn could go back to g5, then at least it would be possible to play ...f5-f4 with a semblance of counterplay.  5. There is no real chance for Black to attack along the h-file. A plan like ...Rh6, ...Qg5-h5 is far too slow and momentarily impossible due to White’s queen on d2.   6. White’s pieces are very well coordinated.  7. White has an immediate queenside break with a2-a4.   This is exactly the kind of example that strategy books use, giving the impression the Stonewall is just bad. Of course, this position is just bad, but there are many things Black could have done to avoid such a disaster. For now, let’s simply observe how White exploits his monumental advantage. } 1. a4 { +- Notice that if Black had a rook on a8 and a pawn on a5, the position would be far more difficult to win, since this move would be answered by ...b5-b4, blocking the queenside. Once the queenside is open, as in this game, Black’s situation is completely hopeless. } 1... Rcf8 2. e3 h5 { The try  26...Rh6  hoping for  ...Qg5-h5  is simply met by  27.Qa5 !  immobilizing Black’s queen, and now a possible continuation is:  27...Ne8  28.axb5  axb5  29.Ra1  Qg5  30.Qb6  +- } 3.

{ @@HeaderStart@@Ognjen Cvitan – Darko Doric, Rijeka 2006@@HeaderEnd@@  Learning objective:   This game illustrates how White may slowly constrain Black’s forces to eventually win through a kingside invasion. } 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. e3 Bd6 5. Bd3 f5 6. O-O Nf6 7. b3 Qe7 8. Bb2 O-O 9. Nc3 { The beginning of an interesting plan.   Another popular option is to insist on trading dark-squared bishops with  9.Qc1  b6  10.Ba3  and now Black may allow the exchange with  10...Nbd7   or prevent the exchange with  10...c5 !?  11.dxc5  bxc5  12.Nc3  Ba6  with level chances as in Petrik – S. Zhigalko, Aix-les-Bains 2011  11.Bxd6  Qxd6  12.cxd5  Nxd5  13.Nbd2  Bb7  14.Nc4  Qe7  15.Nfe5  Rac8  16.Nxd7  Qxd7  17.Ne5  Qe7  18.Qb2  c5  when Black had solved all his problems in Delchev – Tregubov, France 2009. } 9... Ne4 10. Ne2 { This move prepares Ne5 followed by f2-f3 which will give White good control of the centre. } 10... Nd7 11. Ne5 Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bc7 { This is the first critical moment in the game. Black’s main problem is to find a good use for the light-squared bishop. The typical ...Bd7-e8-h5 manoeuvre will not benefit Black since White simply responds with f2-f3. Hence, the only alternative is to place the bishop on the a8-h1 diagonal and advance ...c6-c5.  On the other hand, White’s objective will be to play c4-c5 obtaining a lasting advantage by restraining Black’s bishop permanently. } 13. Rc1 { A logical move, supporting c4-c5.   Another logical alternative was  13.Qc2 !?  also supporting c4-c5, and now after  13...Bb6   better was  13...Bd7  14.Rac1  Rac8  15.c5  b6  fighting against the c5-pawn  14.Rac1  Bd7  15.c5 !  White gained a lasting advantage:  15...Bc7   15...Bxc5 ??  16.Bxe4  +-   or  15...Nxc5 ??  16.Ba3  +-  16.f3  Ng5  17.Bd4  Rfb8  18.a4  b6  19.b4  Qd8  20.Rb1  bxc5  21.Qxc5  a5  22.b5  ± Shariyazdanov – Beshukov, Biel 2002. } 13... Bd7 14. f3 Bb6 { This move turns out to be a crucial waste of two tempos.   If  14...Ng5 ?!  then  15.c5  += restricts the light-squared bishop, and is similar to the game.   A good alternative was  14...Nc5  15.Bb1   or  15.Ba3  Bxe5  16.cxd5  Bd6  where Black is just fine;   more precise is  15.cxd5 !?  cxd5  16.Ba3  Bb6  17.Nd4  with a tiny advantage for White  15...dxc4  16.Rxc4  Na6 !  when Black equalizes after  ...c6-c5  , bringing the light-squared bishop into the game. } 15. Nd4 Ng5 { If  15...Nc5  16.Ba3  += and the pin is somewhat annoying. } 16. Qc2 { Threatening c4-c5. } 16... a5 { This is a rather inaccurate move, though it made no difference in the game. The reason I do not like this move will become clear in my note to White’s 19th.   If  16...c5  (preventing c4-c5)  then  17.Nxf5 !?   or the simple  17.Ne2  Rac8  18.Nf4  += when Black’s centre is somewhat vulnerable  17...exf5  18.cxd5  c4  19.Bxc4  Bxe3+  20.Kh1  when the position is rather unclear, but White’s chances are certainly preferable. } 17. c5 Bc7 18. Ne2 { White has a lasting positional edge thanks to his spatial advantage and Black’s restricted light-squared bishop. } 18... b5 19. a3 { This is positionally correct, but White misses a stronger continuation.   The reason I did not like  16...a5  is because after  19.cxb6 !  it is not possible to recapture ...axb6; thus after  19...Bxb6  20.Bd4  White gains control of the key c5-square, say after:  20...Rab8  21.Bc5  Bxc5  22.Qxc5  Qxc5  23.Rxc5  Nf7  24.f4  ± } 19... Nf7 { But now that Black has played ...Nf7, the following move is logical and very strong: } 20. f4 { Black’s knight does not have a route back to e4, hence weakening the e4-square is not a problem at all. From this point I think Black’s position is nearly lost, and the reader should pay close attention to how White manages to gradually increase his advantage without giving Black any hope of counterplay. } 20... Nh6 21. Nd4 Rab8 22. h3 { Covering the g4-square and preparing an expansion with g2-g4. } 22... g6 { Maybe it was better to attempt something like  22...b4  23.a4 ?!   of course it is better to play  23.Ra1 !?  ±  23...Qe8  24.Rf2  Bc8  25.g3  Ra8  26.Rg2  Ba6  trading the light-squared bishop. } 23. Rf2 Kf7 24. Nf3 Ke8 25. g3 { Cvitan seems to be enjoying himself. He takes his time, but every move brings him one step closer to the win. Now he is preparing Rg2 and g3-g4. } 25... Kd8 26. Rg2 Kc8 27. g4 Bd8 { Of course  27...fxg4  28.hxg4  only worsens Black’s pawn structure. } 28. Kh2 { Again, White does not hurry to open the position yet, as there is no need to do so. Instead, Cvitan slowly arranges his pieces in optimal locations. } 28... Bc7 29. Qd2 Be8 30. Kg1 Bd7 31. Qe1 Be8 32. b4 { This is played in order to support the c5-pawn, as White wants to use his rook on the kingside. } 32... a4 { Having a closed queenside, the rest is just a matter of technique.   Opening the a-file with  32...axb4 ?!  33.axb4  does not exactly help Black, for example:  33...Ra8   33...Kb7  34.Bd4  Ra8  35.Bxb5 !  Opening lines for attack.  35...cxb5  36.c6+ !  Bxc6  37.Rgc2  +-  34.Ra1  Rxa1  35.Qxa1  Kb7  36.Bc3  Followed by  Ra2  with a winning attack.   It was probably better to keep the tension with  32...Ra8 !?  but after  33.Ra1 !?  threatening a3-a4, Black does not have anything better than  33...a4  , which is similar to the game. } 33. Bc3 { +- This move is logical and very strong. It might seem premature, but after this move Black’s position is already clearly lost, for the following reasons:  1. White has a significant spatial advantage, allowing him to manoeuvre freely with his pieces.  2. Only White can open the position favourably, which he will do only once all his forces are ready for the final invasion.  3. Black’s light-squared bishop is locked in and cannot contribute to Black’s play.  4. With the last move, White shows the beginning of the winning strategy. His first step is to play Bc3-e1-h4 to make good use of his bad bishop. } 33... Kb7 34. Qe2 Bd8 35. Be1 Ka6 36. Bh4 Qc7 37. Bxd8 Qxd8 { The first stage is complete. White has exchanged his bad bishop for Black’s good bishop; note how weak the dark squares in Black’s camp have become. } 38. Nd4 Qe7 39. gxf5 { A strong alternative was the direct  39.Qd1 !  threatening  Qxa4  , and now  39...Ka7  40.Bxb5 !  cxb5  41.c6  gives White a winning attack, since Black’s forces lack space and coordination to defend:  41...Ka8  42.Rc5  (threatening Nxb5)  42...Rb6  43.g5  Nf7  44.Qc2  (threatening c6-c7)  44...Kb8  45.Rxb5  Rxb5  46.Nxb5  Bxc6  47.Qxc6 } 39... Nxf5 40. Bxf5 gxf5 { The second stage is complete; White has opened the ^g-file and removed all strategic impurities from the position by trading his bishop for Black’s knight. We are left with a winning battle between White’s strong knight and Black’s useless light-squared bishop. It is impossible to prevent the invasion down the ^g-file. } 41. Kh2 Kb7 42. Rcg1 Bg6 43. Rg5 { Progressing slowly but surely.   A more direct winning approach was:  43.Rxg6 !?  hxg6  44.Rxg6  Rg8  45.Rxe6  Qg7  46.Qf2  Rh8  (threatening ...Rxh3 followed by ...Rh8)  47.Qg2  Qxg2+  48.Kxg2  Rbg8+  49.Kh2 } 43... Rg8 44. Qf2 Rbe8 45. Qh4 Kc7 { If  45...Qg7  preventing  46.Qh6  , then  46.R5g3  Kc7  47.Qg5  followed by h3-h4-h5 winning. } 46. Qh6 { Threatening the decisive h3-h4-h5. } 46... Qf8 47. Qxf8 Rgxf8 48. h4 Re7 49. Kh3 { At this point pretty much every plan will win. White continues to take his time and improve his position slowly.   Another option was  49.h5  Be8  50.Rg7  Kd7  51.h6  since  51...Bg6  fails due to  52.Rxe7+  Kxe7  53.Nxc6+  Kd7  54.Nd4. } 49... Kd7 50. h5 Be8 51. Kh4 h6 52. Rg8 Ref7 { If  52...Rxg8  53.Rxg8  Rh7  White has the nice  54.Rg6 !  Bxg6   or  54...Bf7  55.Rf6  zugzwang  !  55...Bg8  56.Rf8  Bf7  57.Ra8  +-  55.hxg6  Rh8  56.Kh5  Ke7  57.g7  Rg8  58.Kg6 !  h5  59.Nf3  followed by  Kh7  and wins. } 53. Rxf8 Rxf8 54. Rg7+ Rf7 55. Rg6 Re7 { No better is  55...Rh7  56.Rxe6. } 56. Rxh6 Rg7 57. Rxe6 Rg4+ 58. Kh3 Rg1 59. h6 { Final remarks  1. Black’s first mistake was allowing White to play c4-c5, which prevented ...c6-c5, hence restricting the light-squared bishop. This was essentially an opening imprecision. It was necessary to play 12...Bc5 or 14...Nc5.   2. The second mistake was to play 19...Nf7 allowing 20.f4 reinforcing White’s central dominance. This mistake was essentially decisive.  3. White’s win was slow but very convincing and a great model of how to exploit the advantage. Improving Black’s play after move 20 would provide more resistance, but probably would not change the overall result. } *
