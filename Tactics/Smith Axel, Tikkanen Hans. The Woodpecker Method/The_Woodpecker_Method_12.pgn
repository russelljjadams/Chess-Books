For White, 1 Rbe1 is the right square and the right rook, though you need to see a few key lines to understand why.  In the game Carlsen tried to do it all with checks:   1.Qh8+?  Ke7  2.Rfe1+  Be6  The position was messy, but had he played  3.Qh4!?  +=  then White would still be a touch better.  Instead, the "wrong rook" move   1.Rfe1?  allows  1...Be6  +=  when, unlike the main line, White cannot lift the e1-rook, as it would leave its colleague on b1 hanging. } 1...
