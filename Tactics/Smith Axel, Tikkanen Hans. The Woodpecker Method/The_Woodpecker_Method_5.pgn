{ 459. Edgard Colle – Max Euwe, Amsterdam  (1)  1928 } 1. Rxf7 Re8 { White is satisfied to restore material equality. Both players have passed pawns, but only White has active heavy pieces, attacking the queenside pawns. White should not trade off his active rook as he did in the game  (0–1, 35 moves)  (and instead either push the e-pawn)  (best)   or take the b-pawn either immediately or after the intermediate  2.Qe7.   Instead  1...Rxf7  2.Qc8+  ✔ is mate.   White also wins after:  1...Qxf7  2.Rxf7  Rxf7  3.Qc8+!  Rf8  4.Qe6++–  ✔ } *
