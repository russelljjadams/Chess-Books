{ Dear student,  Welcome to the MoveTrainer™ version of the famous Woodpecker Method. We are glad to have you here. Just a few quick words so that you make the most of this course.  First of, if you don't want to read all these informational/read only pages, you can pause entire chapters from the course options in the chapter's variation view. We do recommend you read them though, or at least this first page.  @@StartBlockQuote@@Now, there are two ways to learn the course, with 'Key Moves' or with 'All Moves'. You can change this in your course's options. This is found on the right-hand side of the chapter list view of the course @@StartBracket@@click on the course name from the homepage@@EndBracket@@. If you need help with this, please click on Tools > Help and search for 'course options'.@@EndBlockQuote@@The difference is that with Key Moves, the majority of the puzzles will stop at the 'checkmark' that was set by the grandmaster authors. This will help you move through the book quicker and finish it sooner. The reason the whole variation will not be looked at in this format is that often there are several winning continuations and the authors consider seeing up to the checkmark enough.  If you set yourself for 'All Moves', you will see every single move given in the mainline by the authors, from start to finish. This will take longer and sometimes might mean you play several alternatives before you hit on the mainline. It's up to you in which way you want to study the course, but the default is set to 'Key Moves'  (the checkmarks!)  .  The course uses the most up to date information we have from Quality Chess. We've fixed some small errors in the original print version. However, we have the benefit of being a platform of 'living products'; meaning that we can always update the course if something else is uncovered. We can always change it and improve it for the better.  Therefore, we welcome all feedback, and you can leave it by clicking on a puzzle's title in the MoveTrainer and writing a comment. This helps us know what puzzle your comment pertains to. We then get an e-mail and will respond as soon as possible  (see Tools > Help 'leave a comment')  .  Enjoy!  PS.- As part of this course launch, we've promised a stretch goal, that if the course gets to 1,000 students, we will release a new feature that will make this course even better. So please tell your friends and share the page! Cheers. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Quick Start Guide@@HeaderEnd@@  So, you want to dive in and start solving without reading any of the introductory text now or even at all? That’s the spirit – we encourage everyone to tackle the puzzles as soon as possible and read about the history and philosophy of the method when you wish to take a break. If you favour the Quick Start, you have two main methods of working with this book.  Option 1 – General Solving  If you bought this book to practise exercises in your regular fashion, then turn to this chapter and begin solving the 1128 exercises we have prepared for you. They are assembled in three general levels of toughness. Just a quick word of warning though: as per our personal preference, these are not all "play and win" combinations. The task is to find the best move  (and supporting variations)  and the best move could, for instance, be to force a draw, gain a slight advantage or even avoid falling for a counter-tactic in a seemingly obvious combination. Good luck and have fun!  Quick Start 2 – The Woodpecker Method  If you wish to train using the Woodpecker Method, as advocated in this book, there are a few things you need to know before starting:  1. The general idea of the Method is to develop intuitive/automatic pattern recognition through repetitive solving of the same exercises in a cyclical fashion.  2. As you may already know, or have guessed from the description above, the Woodpecker Method is quite gruelling and not for everyone. Although we believe that most players could benefit greatly from it, the question is whether the time and energy could be better spent on improving another part of your game. For me  (Tikkanen)  , using this method gave me a tremendous increase in stability in time trouble, improved my tactical vision quite a bit, and significantly reduced my blunder rate. I’m very happy I did it, but I will not repeat it in the foreseeable future – for now, I have done enough. If you decide this method might be for you and wish to give it a go, then we wish you the best – may your results reflect your effort!  3. To get the most out of your Woodpecker training, please take a quick look at the instructions on this page before you start. } 1. -- *

[Black "Woodpecker History"]
[Result "*"]

{ @@HeaderStart@@Woodpecker History@@HeaderEnd@@– by Hans Tikkanen  The name of the Woodpecker Method was not invented by me, but it was influenced by me and invented by my co-author, GM Axel Smith. It comes from a translation I’ve heard of my Finnish surname, Tikkanen, which is supposed to mean "little woodpecker". Together with the repetitive nature of the method, it seems fitting, although credit for many of the ideas behind the method lies elsewhere.  While developing and using the method, I did not remember where the basic ideas came from. When the method gained a slightly larger audience after I achieved three GM norms and could not resist questions about my training, I was made aware of the similarity to Michael de la Maza and his "Seven Circles" method from the book Rapid Chess Improvement – A Study Plan for Adult Players. I recognized the name and had indeed read it during my pre-professional time, when I spent several years reading whatever I could get my hands on about the interactions of the human consciousness, the brain and chess. This was done out of curiosity and also to figure out how it should influence my approach to chess playing and training. I think I forgot about that book due to its exclusive focus on adult players  (basically adult beginners)  , and what I considered to be its overly-certain claims and statements with little or doubtful supporting evidence, and other flaws  (a Jeremy Silman review offered an even more harshly worded opinion)  .  While my fascination for the relatively unknown subject matter of the human consciousness and brain remains  (and indeed was a major motivation for ending my intermezzo as a chess professional and starting my studies in psychology)  , it seems to me to be beyond the scope of a chess tactics book, and highly speculative to boot. Regardless, one conclusion I drew from my reading was that a tremendous amount of activity happens unconsciously, below conscious effortful processing, and that this should reasonably be reflected in my approach to chess. I had previously  (on a mostly unconscious level I’m sure!)  been quite dismissive of these kinds of thoughts, and indeed my style at the chess board used to be effortful and concrete rather than intuitive. I would now say that I then unconsciously trusted my intuition to find the right moves to consider, but I only believed in the conscious verification process that seemed to me to be all there was. "Calculation, calculation, calculation!" was my motto. With my subsequent reading of psychological literature, I came to realize that there really is such a thing as intuition and I became much more aware of the unconscious parts of my approach.  Putting it all together  Armed with my new insights, I endeavoured to find or develop training and thinking methods for my personal use. The most successful of them was the Woodpecker Method  (although I didn’t have a catchy name for it then)  , which I used extensively during the spring of 2010. My own experience with the method might be of interest to some, so here it comes.  First, I decided on the general rules of the method. I would solve a set of a thousand exercises  (from various puzzle books)  over whatever time period it took. Once I completed the set, I would take a break and then repeat the process again and again, getting faster each time. I checked my answers against the solutions given in the back of the book, and computer-checked in cases when I did not fully buy the solution provided by the author.  The frustration I feel when an exercise does not make sense has served as a great motivator to make the solutions in this book as accurate as possible!   Being a chess professional, I had very few commitments distracting me from working hard on the solving. Of course, solving exercises in this manner is really hard work, so most days I did not manage a full eight-hour workday; but sometimes I did. Once I reached the end of the set of 1000, I took a well-deserved break, ranging from a full day to over a week. I did no other work on chess during these rest periods, except some playing.  With each cycle of solving, I aimed to halve the total solving time for the thousand exercises from that of the previous cycle. Eventually I was able to solve all of the puzzles within a single day – though not within eight hours. Initially I intended to repeat the whole process every six weeks. Later, however, I decided that "repeat one set of 1000 exercises before a serious tournament" was more realistic.  I hardly need state that the process was a demanding one, but I had a lot of motivation – partly from pent-up frustration due to having blundered away important games, but also because I was trying out of my own method. While it was tough on me, one of the books took even more of a beating – completely falling apart from the repeated solving!  Results of the Training  As mentioned above, I trained with the Woodpecker Method in the spring of 2010. That summer, I achieved three GM norms and surpassed the 2500 barrier, all within a seven-week period. The positive effects did not stop there: the following year, my live rating briefly peaked at 2601.  Such quick results from any type of chess training are rare in my experience, but for me the Woodpecker Method seemed to be just what the doctor ordered! The increased tactical acuity and consistency that came from working so hard with the method significantly decreased my blunders and made me more confident at the board.  Would I have made the same improvement with some other type of training? It’s not impossible – but my playing strength had not taken any significant leap in years, so I had been at a loss as to what to do differently to succeed. Although the Woodpecker Method probably wasn’t the only way for me to raise my play, it certainly proved to be a way. The intersection of my interest in the human mind and my motivation to stop blundering surely helped me to devote more time and effort than I would have put into my usual training.  After my extraordinary success with the Woodpecker Method, I tried going a step further and sometimes managed to trust in my intuition without the perfectionistic need to always verify it. Maybe someday I will be able to play the sort of beautiful, intuitive chess that some great players are known for – that would really be something...  Sharing the Method with Others  Around that time, there were several dedicated chess players in and around the southern part of Sweden, some of whom were working together, and all of us were naturally interested in each other’s improvements and methods. While training with my own method during the spring, I had been quite tight-lipped about what I was doing; not to keep it to myself, but rather to be able to evaluate my experience of it so I could have a more informed opinion to share. After that, for me, glorious summer, I was obviously asked by many people about what I had done to finally take the step from IM to GM.  I described the method and my rationale for adopting it, and several others decided to give it a go. One Swedish trainer has apparently invited his students in the north of our country to work dedicatedly on the method for a while. It has also been mentioned in the Swedish Chess Advent Calendar. Most significantly, the method was given its name in Pump Up Your Rating by Axel, who incorporated it into his own training, which you can read about on the next page. From what I have heard, the results of players who trained using the Woodpecker Method have generally been positive, although I have yet to hear of anyone who put as much work into it as I did. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@A Final Session@@HeaderEnd@@– by Axel Smith  Whereas Hans arranged his sessions to resemble normal working days, mine were more chaotic. Once I was hiking in the mountains the week before the Swedish Championship. Seeing the photos afterwards, I realized that I was staring at the exercise book in most of them. At least the surroundings looked nice in the photos.  Before I travelled to Hungary in December 2015 to chase my last GM norm, I solved the same broken book for the 11th and 12th times. I was determined to do something I had been dreaming of for years: completing a full set of exercises in less than 24 hours. I stayed in a basement room next to the block’s laundry and once every full hour I walked around the room. Twice my wife came with freshly-baked bread – and a chance to quit. I was close to quitting when I had a breakdown somewhere towards the end, but the 978th and last exercise finally arrived after 22 hours and 18 minutes.  There are many possible ways to do the Woodpecker. All of them come down to the same thing: working on the exercises. However, it’s easier to keep on solving if you have a plan. Hans forbade me from recommending the set-up above, for humanitarian reasons. And indeed, my first thought afterwards was "never again".  With that being said, the last session was not only tactically beneficial – it also made it easy to stay focused during the games in Hungary. You are not locking yourself in for day and night only to ruin everything by walking around when you are supposed to think.  Furthermore, for me, the many exercises are connected to the places where I have solved them: the underground in Berlin; a night train to Bucharest; the mountains where I hiked. So those 22 hours in the basement also contained a trip around Europe. } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@General Introduction@@HeaderEnd@@  Tactics, Tactics, Tactics!  Have you ever lost a chess game unnecessarily due to a tactical oversight? You are, to put it mildly, not alone. When we checked a randomized sample of games, we found that more than half of those with decisive results were decided by tactical mistakes. It’s not straightforward to describe exactly what constitutes a tactical mistake, or if the game holds a specific decisive moment, but we used the following criteria to define a decisive tactical mistake:  a  the position was not already lost or seriously worse  b  the move blundered material or allowed a winning combination  c  the opponent exploited the mistake to win the game  In preparation for writing this book, we decided to check the games with decisive results which were contested between grandmasters at the 2016 Swedish Championship. With only 19 such games, it’s clearly not a big enough sample to draw major conclusions. Nevertheless, we were surprised to find that as many as 42% were decided by tactical mistakes. At lower levels, the frequency gets higher and higher, as the following table shows.  Both players rated – Percentage of decisive games decided by tactical mistakes  GMs       42%  2200-2400 44%  2000-2200 63%  1800-2000 72%  The percentages in the three rating bands below GM level are based on 32 randomly chosen games in each category. This is by no means a comprehensive investigation and it doesn’t give the whole picture; time management is also of crucial importance. Another relevant point is that it is harder to avoid tactical mistakes in defensible but passive positions, where the opponent has various attacking ideas and there are fewer decent moves. Nevertheless, it is safe to conclude that tactics have a high priority if you want to score points.  Assuming you have read Hans’ Woodpecker History on page 6, you already have a rough idea of the kind of training you will be doing with this book. Over the next few pages, we will say a bit more about how we have organized the training material and how to get the most out of it.  We have assembled a total of 1128 exercises, divided into three difficulty levels.  Easy  (222 Exercises)    If these exercises are challenging enough for you, then it would seem logical to use the end of this section as your cut-off point, after which you will go back to the beginning for your second cycle. If, on the other hand, you find these puzzles rather easy, then start your set with them anyway! We have deliberately chosen these exercises because they feature simpler tactics than you will find in most puzzle books. A partial benefit of this approach is that it makes the book accessible to a wider audience. However, even if we were designing a Woodpecker program exclusively for players striving for the GM title, we would have started with these puzzles anyway, because they reflect reality. These simple tactics are the kind of things you need to see automatically during your games, rather than having to spend time and energy actively looking for them.  Intermediate  (762 Exercises)    To encourage speed, you will also find some relatively easy exercises in this section. There may also be some which you consider hard, but remember that the goal is not to score 100%, especially in early cycles. Even after working with all of the exercises, we each made quite a few errors when solving the draft. Another point worth keeping in mind is that many of the solutions were overlooked by a World Champion.  Advanced  (144 Exercises)    We would advise the majority of readers not to use this final section for Woodpecker training. Several of the positions are really tricky and more suitable for developing your ability to calculate, which veers slightly away from the main purpose of the Woodpecker Method. That said, we can see this section being useful in a couple of scenarios:  1  For the majority of readers, the Easy and Intermediate sections will contain more than enough material to carry out an intensive Woodpecker training plan. But once you have reached the end of it  (and hopefully noticed a significant leap in your tactical ability over the board)  , you will, at some point, want to think about further training. The final section of more challenging exercises would suit this purpose.  2  For extremists who are already strong players, and who possess the time, energy and motivation to tackle this book in the most demanding way possible, this final section can be included in the main training plan. Try solving all 1128 exercises in cycles under the time constraints detailed in the Instructions section on page 26! To even consider taking on a challenge like this, you should probably be at a level where you are working towards the Grandmaster title.  Speed  When presenting the exercises, we have avoided giving away any prior information about the position’s evaluation or the nature of the tactical motif waiting to be found. Other puzzle books may have their own reasons for including this information, but we want to keep the training as close as possible to a real game.  In some exercises, the task is to finish off a promising position which may be winning even without the tactic. In other cases, there are several winning moves. These are deliberate choices, to reflect different situations which occur during practical play. It’s important to be as accurate as possible and to practise decision-making in all scenarios.  Tactical motifs usually appear effortlessly in our minds, but they don’t travel alone; we also need to think methodically and work out the variations with some accuracy. So the Woodpecker Method is not only developing pattern recognition but also calculation, focus, decision-making – and speed.  Once you know certain patterns and motifs, speed is key. The fastest thoughts are those that come to us automatically and while negative automatic thoughts can be a huge problem in psychopathology, automaticity has great benefits as well. The more automatic the search for motifs is, the greater is the chance that you will see enough. We take the view that a good way to develop automaticity is to solve a set of exercises repeatedly, gradually reducing the need for conscious searching. If this sounds somewhat similar to learning to ride a bike, that is because it is.  Other Points about the Exercises  We have long held the view that virtually all books on chess combinations are missing something central to real-game tactics: red herrings. When using conventional puzzle books, solving exercises sometimes becomes like watching a certain type of movie – you just know that everything will work out in the end. From a movie, it can detract tension and excitement, while in tactics training it can detract uncertainty and exactness.  We therefore decided it was important to include some red herrings, where the most obvious attempts backfire. By taking away the certainty that even seemingly easy tactical shots are fool-proof, we aim to bring the training experience one step closer to that of an actual game. While there could be an argument that this type of book is not necessarily the best forum for red herrings, we wanted to put our money where our mouths are.  A common mistake is to stop too early in a variation, maybe only a single move before there’s a crucial tactic. However, narrowing your search down to the critical lines is an important skill for a human player  (even computers have to do it!)  and trusting your intuition is the best way of doing this. Therefore, after a training session, it might be a good idea to think about why you failed certain exercises to see where your intuition misled you. But don’t spend too much time dwelling on it – developing pattern recognition is best done on a mostly unconscious level. The good news is that training your tactical pattern recognition will increase the chance that the motif appears in your head while you visualize the position.  A final point about the exercises is that we have not only computer-checked the solutions, but also humanly checked them  (thanks to our test solvers, Martin Jogstad and Tom Rydström)  . This brought to our attention some plausible attempts which the computer instantly dismisses, but which appear tempting to a human. This enabled us to improve the solutions by mentioning some of those variations that almost work. } 1. -- *

{ World Champions  Although there was no special reason to set a theme for the exercises, we decided to take our test positions exclusively from games involving all World Champions, from Steinitz to Carlsen  (including the FIDE KO World Champions)  . The champions are on the losing side in about 25% of the games. So sometimes you will do better than them, while other times your task is to play as well – and that’s also a fair goal. The featured tactics are not necessarily flashy, and you have probably seen some of the examples before – but that’s part of the idea, as repeating the same motifs is an integral part of our method.  As we will see in this book, it’s possible to find tactical resources even in worse positions. We were surprised at how many blunders we encountered the move before the combination. True, there are quite a few positions from simuls where the champion faced weaker opponents, but tactical mistakes are also far from unheard of in World Championship matches. As we have strived to check all the available games played by the World Champions, the selection is hopefully quite representative. In each of the three exercise sections  (Easy, Intermediate and Advanced)  you will find examples involving each champion. Throughout each section, the games of each champion appear in approximate chronological order.  We were much more focused on the chess content than on perfect ordering of the games.   At a FIDE Trainer seminar, a coach claimed that it was important for aspiring players to know the full list of World Champions in order. He was serious and Axel didn’t get it right when taking the exam. A few years later, neither of us could recall the list below in order; and trying to write down the years was not even close to possible. You’re welcome to improve on our efforts, but you’re also free to skip the list, finish the introductory section and start to find combinations like a World Champion.

When moviegoers were shown 1/3000-second advertisements for Coca-Cola and popcorn, the product sales increased without anyone being aware of the advert.  Today, it is well researched that humans use subliminal perception to speed up the brain process. When it comes to chess, the reoccurrence of a certain configuration can prime your brain that there may be a combination, a piece manoeuvre or pawn lever. However, finding a move intuitively is sometimes seen as a negative habit: "You have not worked thoroughly enough to deserve credit for the solution." Nothing could be more wrong, as seen from a scientific viewpoint.  The Woodpecker Method is designed to develop that kind of intuition – so make use of it! Every combination you have ever seen has prepared your chess brain for giving such advice. And after you have followed the Woodpecker Method, it will be ready like never before.   Finding the correct first move always gives one point, but don’t depend solely on your intuition. Every position is unique and requires some supporting calculation – trust the input from your intuition, but always verify it!  A few decades after his study, Vicary revealed that it was all a gimmick. He did not have enough data to support his bold claim, and has failed to replicate it since. But there was a grain of truth in what he was saying, and he inspired Axel’s grandfather to do research where participants were shown subliminal images with scary faces. That made them interpret other images as being frightful as well.  So, it might be possible to put a chess player in an aggressive mode by showing subliminal diagrams where one side has castled long and won with an attack on the king...  Solving Sessions  "Life puzzle" is a Swedish expression which originates from a political campaign and points out the difficulty of organizing work, social media, household work, "quality time" with the family, and "time-when-you-do-things-for-yourself" – another common expression which is shorter in Swedish  (just seven letters)  . The essence is the core of the Swedish mentality: life is a puzzle to be solved, rather than chaos to be endured.  It is not up to us to advise you how much time to dedicate to chess. We can, however, say something about the desired quality of this study time. Find a quiet place and set a time limit so you are able to focus until the end. Start solving, and do it seriously – as in a tournament game. That means looking ahead to make sure that your solution really works, but still trying to work through the exercises as quickly as possible.  Should a Real Board and Pieces be used?  Whether or not one should solve using a real board is a contentious issue among trainers. Some, especially more old-school trainers, might argue that you always should. Artur Yusupov is one example of a renowned trainer who emphasizes the importance of using a board and pieces in his multi-volume training series  (also published by Quality Chess)  . Others don’t see it as being so important. You obviously have to choose for yourself, but we can give you our two cents: neither of us used a board and pieces for our Woodpecker training. There is most likely a generational divide: players of a certain age, who developed their chess skills before the computer era, are more likely to value a board and pieces; whereas those who have spent a significant portion of their formative years studying chess using computers tend not to be put off by the two-dimensional aspect of solving from diagrams in a book  (or on a screen, for those who bought the Forward Chess edition)  .  Obviously you should do what feels right for you. A possible compromise is to take an initial glance at each exercise directly in the book. If you solve it within a few seconds, then move on to the next exercise. On those occasions when you have yet to find the solution within roughly one minute  (or whatever timeframe you find most appropriate)  , set the position up on a board if it helps you to think more clearly. One optional way to get some extra training out of this process is to set the position up from memory as far as possible – but don’t forget the main purpose of your training.  Our general thinking is that with the huge amount of positions which we study nowadays from diagrams with computer databases, internet play and so on, solving from the book should mostly use the same neural configurations and thus be similar enough and good enough for these short exercises. True, classical tournament play still involves a physical board and pieces, so an argument could be made for replicating that in training. You may also wish to take into account the extra time invested in setting up the pieces, which adds up to quite a lot when you are dealing with anything up to a thousand exercises. From our point of view, this time could be better spent by solving more exercises  (or with loved ones)  . If we were solving harder exercises requiring ten or more minutes of effort, we would probably use a board, but that’s the kind of training used to develop deeper calculation rather than pattern recognition.  There is one absolute advantage that we see in using a board and pieces  (apart from the aesthetic/hedonistic one)  : that is, the possibility of playing the moves out in order to see the final pattern take shape on the board, while possibly developing some muscle memory at the same time. For some players, the process of playing out the solution might negatively impact on their overall speed and ability to focus on the main task, while others might find it helpful having a microbreak for setting up the pieces before moving on to the next exercise. We will repeat our advice for a final time: think about the pros and cons of each approach; experiment with a mixed approach if you need to; and ultimately do what works best for you.  How much do you need to see?  "Enough" is the short answer, but the question is important and deserves further reflection, even though it’s seldom discussed in similar books. As we have already stated, we think that the task of solving should be quite similar to a real game. That’s why we have included certain exercises as red herrings and others which contain several winning moves. } 1. -- *

{ When looking ahead, it's sometimes difficult to decide when to stop and evaluate the position. It's always possible to calculate a move further... Oh, wait - no it's not. We are, after all, only human, so from time to time we need to make an evaluation before the tactical operation is over.  There are the usual clues to help us: whose pieces are better placed ? Do more and more options appear when we calculate ? Which side needs to prove something ? The process of decisionmaking involves complex concepts such as reliability  (how certain is the evaluation ?)  , grading  (how important is this decision ?)  and the trade-off between maximizing our chances and the risks incurred in doing so  (is there a safer alternative ?)  .   With hindsight, its easy to say when you should have continued calculating. Explanations like "you had not yet solved the problem with the back rank" sound sensible and almost obvious, but anyone can be wise after the event. Its the same with finding critical moments: they are easy to identify afterwards.  It can be helpful to think about such things and identify useful clues for future reference, but excessive explanations carry a risk of suppressing your intuition and with it your human strength. The complex concepts mentioned above work best unconsciously. Your intuition may fail from time to time, but it improves with experience.  Here is one example where the position can be evaluated even though there are more lines to calculate.  Boris Spassky - Lothar Zinn, Marianske Lazne 1962 } 1. Nxf7 Kxf7 { 24...Nxd6  25.Nxd6  +-  does not win back the exchange straight away  (Black can pin the knight)  , but Blacks position will soon collapse after 26 Qe5. } 2. Bxe6+ Qxe6 3. Rxe6 Kxe6 { Black has enough material for the queen, and he would be fine if he had time to return with the king to safety. There is a way to stop that. } 4. Qb3+ Ke7 5. Qg8 { 29 Bg5 is a threat. } 5... h6 { The game is not technically over, but its hard to imagine that Black will be able to free himself with all of his pieces stuck on the queenside. Its safe to trust the intuition that White is winning - and its fair to do so even before seeing 28 Qg8 !  The primary aim of this book is to provide you with the means to develop your pattern recognition and intuition. Trying to calculate every variation until the end with a bookkeepers mentality would be counterproductive. Trust your intuition, but with care ! } *

{ Moves with ✔ Signs  In the solutions, the moves marked with this ‘tick’ symbol are those which we think you ought to see before executing the combination in a game. In other words: the ticked move is what you would need to see to be sure that the first move is the best in the position – and sometimes a little more as with 29...Bxg2! above. When a move of the opponent is marked with a ✔, you score a point for having noticed it and determined that it’s no problem.  @@StartBlockQuote@@Chessable note: On our MoveTrainer course, if you study with the 'Key Moves' option by default, most puzzles will stop at the checkmark sign ✔ If you'd like to be quizzed beyond this, please change your course options to 'All Moves'.@@EndBlockQuote@@It is not always easy to say which moves must be seen in advance to earn the ✔ – we debated this issue in many solutions. If you find yourself strongly disagreeing with our choice in a particular solution, then give yourself full points anyway. Trust your own judgement, but don’t fall into the trap of being too kind to yourself. We had a friend who always found an excuse when he didn’t see the whole solution: 'I knew I had a move there,' he said. 'During a game I would have found it.' But when he blundered during the games he wasn’t allowed to take his move back. So apply some common sense: don’t cheat against yourself, but don’t be too harsh either.  If you have chosen another winning continuation marked in the solution  (often with 'or')  , you also earn full points. We have tried to note all relevant winning methods, but sometimes there are too many; or it may be that you chose to insert an intermediate check or something similar before executing the main combination. Again, use your common sense as to whether or not you found the right idea. If in doubt, you can always check your solution using an engine. In general, we give the critical moves as the main line. The game continuations are not always mentioned, but when it’s smooth we have given it for completeness  (as in Smyslov – Addison above)  .  Since the timescale is a crucial element to the Woodpecker Method, you don’t have to check all the variations – especially when working on your second and subsequent cycles. If you are curious about some details, you can always check them some time in between training sessions when the clock isn’t ticking.  Finally, let us remind you that your objective in each training session will be to solve as quickly and accurately as possible. Thus, please don’t take this book to bed and attempt to solve as you are falling asleep, or in the morning when you have barely woken up. We want to encourage good habits, not bad ones! } 1. -- *

{ @@HeaderStart@@Summary of Tactical Motifs@@HeaderEnd@@  To calculate well, you need to be able to visualize positions in your head, and to know about methods such as blunder-checking, candidate moves, comparison and choosing which move to calculate first. However, you also need to recognize tactical motifs on a more or less unconscious level. That skill is improved by seeing a vast number of them – as will happen in this book.  The human mind is good at decoding and organizing abstract concepts to be able to retrieve them when needed. When we consciously intervene in the process, we risk losing the automaticity. However, there are a few good books that give a theoretical foundation to tactical motifs, and it would do no harm to read one of those books before solving mixed exercises, as in this book. Since learning the different motifs is something that we recommend any serious player should do at least once in his or her career, it seems profitable to do so before training with the Woodpecker Method.  Since this is a workbook and not a full tactical course, we will limit ourselves to a list of the main tactical motifs, with one basic example for each of them. Read carefully – the positions may turn up again. } 1. -- *

{ Woodpecker training is hard. To get the maximum benefit from it, we recommend that you follow the methodology described in this short section.  First, a couple of definitions:  Set: The exercises which you will solve before you start all over again.  Cycle: One round of solving the set. Normally you will perform up to seven cycles with one set.  The Woodpecker Method in Five Steps  Step 1  Cycle 1: Solve as many exercises as you can manage in four weeks. These exercises are your set; and solving them brings you to the end of your first cycle.  The exact time period can be adjusted according to your lifestyle and circumstances, but try not to spend much more than four weeks. If you find yourself taking much longer than four weeks, you have probably either not been putting in sufficient time, or have included too many exercises in your set.   @@StartBlockQuote@@Chessable note: Chessable works on a different review schedule than the authors recommend here. You can simply ignore Chessable's Review button if you like, and review according to your own schedule or the one the authors recommend. We have set a stretch goal, in that if the course hits 1,000 students in a month, we will write code for a new custom feature, so that this course can work as per the author's recommendations by default. @@EndBlockQuote@@Step 2  Take a break from chess for at least a clear day, and up to a week if you need it.  Step 3  Cycle 2: Solve the same set of exercises but faster: within two weeks is the target.  Step 4  Repeat steps 2 and 3, and repeat again. Aim to complete each cycle in half the number of days as the previous cycle  (rounded up, when dealing with an odd number of days)  .  Step 5  The Woodpecker Method has been completed when the full set of exercises has been solved entirely in one day – or after the 7th cycle, if you are unable to solve the full set in a day. In the final two cycles, you should focus more on spotting ideas, patterns and motifs at speed, and less on the finer details of calculation. } 1. -- *

[Black "Customizing The Woodpecker Method"]
[Result "*"]

{ Customizing The Woodpecker Method  The five-step plan is straightforward enough, but a crucial variable is missing: how much time should you spend solving during the initial four weeks? Since the answer will depend on your level of ambition and life situation, it has to be your decision. Before you begin, we recommend that you set a target timetable with upper and lower limits. Between five and ten hours per week would seem realistic for an amateur player with work and/or family commitments. By setting a loose schedule, you ensure a certain amount of personal accountability for your training, while also having some leeway for unforeseen events. Life may have a tendency to get in the way; but if chess improvement is really important to you, we urge you to set an ambitious schedule and follow it ruthlessly  (barring any life-changing events of course)  .  As an optional extra to setting a target number of hours per week, some players may find extra motivation by choosing the number of exercises beforehand. The appropriate number will depend on one’s playing strength, ambition and time available. A reasonable number for a working amateur might be 250. Ultra-ambitious players with significant time and energy to devote to training may go for around 1000 as we did; or even the mega-set of 1128 exercises in this book. Remember to take into account the difficulty level, and be ready to adjust your target as you go along. For instance, if you set a target of 800 positions, but have only solved half that number after four weeks, you probably set the initial target too high. } 1. -- *

{ Other Guidelines  Solve the exercises in order. If you are stuck and unable to find a solution, then choose a move anyway, as you would have to do the same in a game. As time is an important factor, we recommend limiting the time you spend writing down and checking your solutions. Neither of us made any notes, and we only checked the solutions when we were uncertain. However, if you find it at all difficult to remember the lines you have calculated, feel free to write them down, especially for the first one or two cycles. Some players have told us they found it useful to alternate between solving a number of exercises  (for example a page)  and then checking the relevant solutions before moving on to the next page of exercises. Regardless of which way you prefer, just keep in mind that you should still try to maintain your pace. Compared to later cycles, the first cycle will likely use a larger portion checking the solutions, which is quite alright. Having to check solutions less in later cycles will help you finish the set in the allotted time. } 1. -- *

{ Scoring  After each session, note the time taken and the number of exercises. Counting the number of points you have scored is optional.

We trusted our conscience; if we overlooked too many moves, we slowed down on the next session  (or during the current one)  .  On the other hand, keeping a record of your scores also brings certain benefits. It may serve as a motivator when you know you will be competing with yourself and striving to score more points than in your previous cycle  (s)  . It also provides feedback as to whether you are seeing enough. This is especially important from the second cycle onward, to avoid being satisfied with remembering the first move of the solution.

With every additional cycle, your increased recognition should compensate for the decreasing deadlines.

{ Reaching The End  The Woodpecker Method has been completed when the full set of exercises has been solved in a single day  (or after seven cycles, if one day proves unattainable)  . Time to celebrate! But where should you go from here? First and foremost, the ideal next step will be able to play some tournaments and put your improved tactical ability to use. As far as subsequent training is concerned, this will depend on your playing strength and goals. Woodpecker training is hard, so you will probably want to take a break from it for a while, and perhaps train some other aspect of your game. When you are ready though, you may wish to consider one of the following approaches.  If your first bout of Woodpecker training comprised a set of, say, the first 250 exercises from this book, the way to build upon your progress is obvious: after taking a suitable break, begin a new four-week cycle using further exercises from this book. You will now be at the intermediate difficulty level, but you should be well and truly ready for it by now.  Readers who began their Woodpecker training with a high level of playing strength and ambition may have been able to take on a larger set, perhaps comprising the 984 exercises in the easy and intermediate sections, or even the difficult section as well, for a brutal total of 1128 exercises. If you were able to complete a set like this within a day  (or over seven cycles)  then your tactical ability should have taken a significant leap. To maintain and build upon the gains you have made, it is a good idea to redo the set approximately once every six weeks, or at least as a warm-up before an important tournament. For anyone keen/crazy enough to want to repeat the entire method, there are plenty of other exercise/puzzle books on the market... } 1. -- *
